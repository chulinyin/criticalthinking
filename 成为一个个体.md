In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as something we are born with but rather as something  acquired—or, more precisely, earned. Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossible to escape being influenced by  other people and by circumstance. The essence of individuality is vigilance. The following guidelines will help you achieve this:

1. Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative. No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to  embrace it until you have examined it.

2. Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else—a parent or friend,  perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to  react this way.

3. Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or situation.

4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction. And when you answer, resist the  influence of your conditioning.


根据我们讨论的内容，我们应该把个体视为不是我们与生俱来的一些东西，而后天习得的，或者更加精确地说，是挣得的一些东西。个体开始于认识到，逃离被其他人和环境影响是不可能的。个体的本质是警惕。以下指南将帮助你实现这点：

1. 把你对任何人、问题或者情况的第一反应看作暂时性的。无论它多么吸引你，拒绝接受它，直到你仔细检查了它。

2. 确定为什么你会那样反应。考虑你是否从任何其他人（父母或者朋友 ，或者一个名人，或者电视上一个虚构的角色 ）那里带来了这个反应。如果可能，确定是什么具体的经历让你这样反应。
3. 思考你对这个人、问题或者情况，可能拥有的其他反应。
4. 问自己，是否另一个反应比你的第一反应更合适。并且当你回答时，抗拒你的条件的影响。

To ensure that you will really be an individual and not merely claim to be one, apply these guidelines throughout your work in  this book, as well as in your everyday life.

为了确保你将会真正成为一个个体，而不仅仅是声称成为一个人，在这本书以及你的日常生活的所有工作中应用这些指南。
