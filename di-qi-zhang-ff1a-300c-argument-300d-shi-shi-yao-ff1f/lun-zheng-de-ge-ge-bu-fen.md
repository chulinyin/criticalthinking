> The field of knowledge most closely associated with the study of argument is logic, which, like other fields that deal with complex matters, has its own special terminology. Since this book is more practical than theoretical, we will limit our concern to those terms that signify the parts of an argument: the premises and the conclusion. In the argument about Wynona mentioned above, the premises are “The law prohibits teachers from leading class prayers in public schools” and “Wynona leads students in prayer in her public school classroom.” The conclusion is “Therefore,Wynona is breaking the law.” \(The word therefore and synonyms such as_so_and_consequently_are often used to identify conclusions. Where they are not used, you can usually identify the conclusion by answering the question, Which assertion do the other assertions support or reinforce?\)

与论证研究最密切相关的知识领域是逻辑学，它就像其他处理复杂事物的领域一样，有它自己的专门术语。鉴于本书是偏向于实践的，我们将把我们的注意力限制在那些表示论证部分的术语：前提/假设和结论。在之前提到的关于 Wynona 的论证中，前提是“法律禁止老师在公立学校带领班级祈祷”和“Wynona带领学生在她的公立学校教师里祈祷。”结论是“因此，Wynona违反了法律。”（单词「therefore」，以及它的同义词「so」和「consequently」经常被用于确定结论。当它们没有被用到时，你通常可以通过回答这个问题来确定结论——「哪句断言支持或者证实了另外的断言」？）

> The basic principles logicians use in evaluating arguments are asfollows:

逻辑学家在评估论点时使用的基本原则如下：

1. > The premises are either true or false \(correct or incorrect\).

   前提是对的还是错的（正确的还是不正确的）。

2. > The reasoning that links the premises to the conclusion is either valid or invalid. \(To be valid, the stated conclusion, and only that conclusion, must follow from the premises.\)

   把前提和结论联系起来的推理是有效的还是无效的。（为了使之有效，所陈述的结论（并且仅仅那个结论）必须是根据前提得出的）

3. > Correct premises plus valid reasoning equal a sound argument.

   正确的前提再加上有效的推理等于一个合理的论证。

4. > Either an incorrect premise or invalid reasoning will render an argument unsound. Mistakes are as common in logical thinking as they are in mathematics.

   不正确的前提或者无效的推理会得出一个不合理的结论。错误在逻辑思维中和在数学中一样普遍。

> This is true not only of other people’s thinking but of our own as well. Just as we can have accurate numbers and do our best to add carefully yet come up with the wrong answer, so, too, can we proceed from accurate informa-tion to a wrong conclusion. Of course, when we start with inaccurate or incomplete information or reason recklessly, the chances of error are compounded. Here is an interesting \(and humorous\) example of reckless reasoning: After a worker was fired for being habitually late, his attorney argued that the supervisor was at fault for not demanding that the man wear a watch!1

不仅是其他人的思维，也是我们自己的。正如我们有正确的数字，并且尽力仔细相加，然而还是得出了错误的答案一样，我们也可能从正确的信息得到一个错误的结论。当然，当我们从不正确、不完整的信息或胡乱的理由开始时，出错的机会也会加大。这里有一个有趣（并且幽默）的关于关胡乱推理的例子：在一个工人由于习惯性地迟到而被解雇后，他的律师争论说，这是主管的错，因为他没有命令这个工人戴表。

> Inappropriate attitudes toward ideas and the reasoning process can also lead to errors in argument. For example, if you regard your first impressions as infallible, you are likely to embrace them uncritically, seek out evidence that supports them and reject evidence that challenges them,and defend them rabidly. Such an approach leaves you vulnerable both to self-deception and to manipulation by others. In contrast, if you regardyour first impressions tentatively—as interesting possibilities rather thancertainties—and compare them to other ideas before making up your mind, you are less likely to fool yourself or be deceived by others.

对观点和推理过程的不适当态度也会导致在论证中出错。例如，如果你认为你的第一印象是绝对可靠的，你可能会非理性地接受它们，找出支持它们的结论，拒绝反对它们的证据，并狂热地保卫它们。这种方式会让你易受自我欺骗和他人控制。相反，如果你把你的第一印象暂时当作有趣的可能性而不是确定性，并在做出决定之前，将之与其他观点比较，你就不太可能欺骗自己或者被他人欺骗。
