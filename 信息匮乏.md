> The quality of a belief depends to a considerable extent on the quality of the information that backs it up. Because it’s a big world and reality has many faces, it’s easy for us to be misinformed. How many drivers take the wrong turn because of faulty directions? How many people get on the wrong bus or train? How many car owners put too much or too little air in their tires on the advice of some service station attendant? And, if mis-information is common enough in such relatively simple matters, how much more common is it in complex matters like law and medicine and government and religion?

一个信念的质量很大程度上取决于支持它的信息的质量。因为这是一个巨大的世界，现实有许多面，我们很容易得到错误信息。有多少司机由于不可靠的指引转错了方向？有多少人上错了公交或者火车？有多少车主根据一些加油站服务员的建议，在他们的轮胎里放了太多或太少的空气？如果错误信息在这种相对简单的事情上都很常见，那在法律、医学、政府和宗教等复杂事情上，它得多么常见？

> It’s possible, of course, to devote a lifetime of study to a particular field. But not even those who make that kind of commitment can know everything about their subject. Things keep happening too fast. They occur whether we’re watching or not. There’s no way to turn them off when we take a coffee break or go to the bathroom. The college student who hasn’t been home in three months may be able to picture the neighbor’s elm tree vividly, yet it may have been cut down two months ago. The soldier may have total recall of his hometown—every sight and sound and smell—and return home to find half of Main Street sacrificed to urban renewal, the old high school hangout closed, and a new car in his best friend’s drive way.

当然，毕生致力于研究一个特定的领域是可能的。但是，即使是那些做出这种承诺的人，也不可能知道他们研究领域中的一切。事情总是发生得太快了。不论我们是否正在看，它们都发生了。当我们喝咖啡休息或者上厕所的时候，没有办法关闭它们。3个月没回家的大学生或许能够生动地描绘邻居的榆树，然而它可能已经在两个月前被砍掉了。士兵或许有他家乡的完整回忆——每个视线、声音和气味，而回家时发现半条主街为了城市的复兴牺牲了，老高中住所关闭了，一辆新车在他最好的朋友的车道。
