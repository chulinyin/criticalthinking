# 介绍

> Beyond Feelings is designed to introduce you to the subject of critical thinking. The subject may be new to you because it has not been emphasized in most elementary and secondary schools. In fact, until fairly recently, most colleges gave it little attention. For the past four decades, the dominant emphasis has been on subjectivity rather than objectivity, on feeling rather than on thought.

这本书的目的是向你介绍理性思维的主题。你可能第一次听说这门课程，是因为它在大多数初高中学校里还没有被重视。事实上，目前为止，大多数大学都几乎不关注它。在过去的四十年，占主导地位的重点是主观而不是客观，是感觉（感性）而不是思考（理性）。

> Over the past several decades, however, a number of studies of America’s schools have criticized the neglect of critical thinking, and a growing number of educators and leaders in business, industry, and the professions have urged the development of new courses and teaching materials to overcome that neglect.

然而在过去的几十年中，一些美国学校的学者们批判对理性思维的忽视，为了克服忽视，在商业、工业和专业领域，越来越多的的教育者和领导者开始催促新课程和教材的开发。

> It is no exaggeration to say that critical thinking is one of the most important subjects you will study in college regardless of your academic major. The quality of your schoolwork, your efforts in your career, your contributions to community life, your conduct of personal affairs—all will depend on your ability to solve problems and make decisions.

可以毫不夸张地说，理性思维是你将在大学学习的最重要的一门课程之一（除了你的必修课）。你学业的质量，你职业生涯的贡献，你个人事情的处理方式，都将取决于你解决问题和做决定的能力。

> The book has three main sections. The first, “The Context,” will help you understand such important concepts as individuality, critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument and overcome attitudes and ideas that obstruct critical thinking. The second section, “The Pitfalls,” will teach you to recognize and avoid the most common errors in thinking.
