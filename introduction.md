# 介绍

> Beyond Feelings is designed to introduce you to the subject of critical thinking. The subject may be new to you because it has not been emphasized in most elementary and secondary schools. In fact, until fairly recently, most colleges gave it little attention. For the past four decades, the dominant emphasis has been on subjectivity rather than objectivity, on feeling rather than on thought.

这本书的目的是向你介绍理性思维的主题。你可能第一次听说这门课程，是因为它在大多数初高中学校里还没有被重视。事实上，目前为止，大多数大学都几乎不关注它。在过去的四十年，占主导地位的重点是主观而不是客观，是感觉（感性）而不是思考（理性）。

> Over the past several decades, however, a number of studies of America’s schools have criticized the neglect of critical thinking, and a growing number of educators and leaders in business, industry, and the professions have urged the development of new courses and teaching materials to overcome that neglect.

然而在过去的几十年中，一些美国学校的学者们批判对理性思维的忽视，为了克服忽视，在商业、工业和专业领域，越来越多的的教育者和领导者开始催促新课程和教材的开发。

> It is no exaggeration to say that critical thinking is one of the most important subjects you will study in college regardless of your academic major. The quality of your schoolwork, your efforts in your career, your contributions to community life, your conduct of personal affairs—all will depend on your ability to solve problems and make decisions.

可以毫不夸张地说，理性思维是你将在大学学习的最重要的一门课程之一（除了你的必修课）。你学业的质量，你职业生涯的贡献，你个人事情的处理方式，都将取决于你**解决问题和做决定的能力**。

> The book has three main sections. The first, “The Context,” will help you understand such important concepts as individuality, critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument and overcome attitudes and ideas that obstruct critical thinking. The second section, “The Pitfalls,” will teach you to recognize and avoid the most common errors in thinking. The third section, “A Strategy,” will help you acquire the various skills used in addressing problems and issues. This section includes tips on dentifying and overcoming your personal intellectual weaknesses as well as techniques for becoming more observant, clarifying issues, conducting inquiries, evaluating evidence, analyzing other people’s views, and making sound judgments.

这本书有三个主要部分。第一部分，“背景知识”，这将帮助你**知道个体、理性思维、真理、知识、观点、证据和论点的概念**，并克服阻碍理性思维的态度和想法。第二部分，“误区”，这将教你**识别和避免思维最常见的错误**。第三部分，“策略”，这将帮助你获得处理困难和问题时的各种技巧。这部分包括**找出并克服你个人的智力弱点**的小窍门，以及**变得更加善于观察**、**澄清问题**、**进行调查**、**评估证据**、**分析他人意见**、**作出正确判断**的技巧。

> At the end of each chapter, you will find a number of applications to challenge your critical thinking and help you exercise your skills. These applications cover problems and issues both timely and timeless. The final application in each of the first thirteen chapters invites you to examine an especially important issue about which informed opinion is divided.

在每章的最后，你将会发现许多应用，它们用来挑战你的理性思维并帮助你锻炼你的技能。这些应用涵盖了及时的和永恒的困难和问题。在每前13章的最终应用会邀请你调查一个特别重要的问题——`被告知的观点中哪一条是有分歧的`。

> Students sometimes get the idea that a textbook must be read page by page and that reading ahead violates some unwritten rule. This notion is mistaken. Students’ background knowledge varies widely; what one student knows very well, another knows only vaguely and a third is totally unfamiliar with. Any time you need or want to look ahead to an explanation  in a later chapter, by all means do so. Let’s say you make a statement and a friend says, “That’s relativism, pure and simple.” If you aren’t sure exactly what she means, go to the index, look up “relativism,” proceed to the appropriate page, and find out.

学生往往认为一本教科书必须被逐页阅读，跳读会违背一些不成文的规定。这个概念是错误的。不同学生的背景知识差别很大。对一个知识可能一个学生很清楚，另一个学生仅仅有点儿知道，第三个则完全陌生。你需要或者想要提前看后面章节中的一个解释，任何时候都可以这样做。比方说你做了一个陈述，然后一个朋友说，“相对主义纯粹而简单。”如果你不知道她到底是什么意思，去搜索和查找相对主义，前往相应的页面找到它的意思。

> Looking ahead is especially prudent in the case of concepts and procedures relevant to the end-of-chapter applications. One such concept is plagiarism. If you are not completely clear on what constitutes plagiarism, why it is unacceptable, and how to avoid it, take a few minutes right now to learn. Look for the section “Avoiding Plagiarism” toward the end of the Chapter 2. Similarly, if you are not as skilled as you would like to be doing library or Internet research, it would be a good idea to read Chapter 17 now. Doing so could save you a great deal of time and effort completing homework assignments.

在概念和过程与章节的最后应用有关的的情况下，跳读是特别明智的。其中一个这样的概念是抄袭。如果你完全不清楚什么构成了抄袭，为什么它是不能被接受的，以及怎样避免它，现在花几分钟时间学习它。在第二章节的结尾可以找到“避免抄袭”部分。同样，如果你对图书馆或者互联网查找不是像你期望的那样熟练，现在去读17章将是一个好主意。这样做可以节省你你完成家庭作业的大量时间和精力。
