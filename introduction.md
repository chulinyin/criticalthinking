# 介绍

> Beyond Feelings is designed to introduce you to the subject of critical thinking. The subject may be new to you because it has not been emphasized in most elementary and secondary schools. In fact, until fairly recently, most colleges gave it little attention. For the past four decades, the dominant emphasis has been on subjectivity rather than objectivity, on feeling rather than on thought.

> 这本书的主题是向你介绍理性思维。你可能第一次听说这个主题，因为它在大多数初高中学校里还没有被重视。
