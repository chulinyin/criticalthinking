It would seem that deciding when an inquiry is complete should be easy. More often than not, however, it is not easy at all.  One insight can make a great difference. A single new fact can upset a mountain of evidence. For example, in the late 1960s  and early 1970s, most social psychologists probably would have agreed that crowded living conditions are harmful to humans.  Numerous experiments seemed to have settled the matter. Then anthropologist Patricia Draper studied a southwest African  tribe of hunter-gatherers, the !Kung bushmen. Though their land offers ample space to spread out their settlements and huts,  they crowd their dwellings together and often sit in tight groups, literally brushing against one another. Yet they have none of  the medical conditions \(such as high blood pressure\) usually associated with crowding.3 This one fact has caused reexamination of a scientific truism.



Because the aim of inquiry is to produce evidence, it will be helpful to recall the guidelines presented in Chapter 6 for determining when evidence is sufficient:

1. Evidence is sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Wishing, assuming, or pretending that a judgment is correct does not constitute certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute. The standard for conviction in a criminal trial, for example, is “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Certainty is a very difficult standard to meet, especially in controversial issues, so you will generally be forced to settle for a more modest standard.

2. If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability.  This means that the view in question is demonstrably more reasonable than any competing view. In civil court cases, this  standard is expressed as “a preponderance of the evidence.” Demonstrating reasonableness is, of course, very different  from merely asserting it, and all possible views must be identified and evaluated before any one view can be established as most reasonable.

3. In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient. In other words, if the evidence does not show one view to be more reasonable than competing views, the only prudent course of action is to withhold judgment until sufficient  evidence is available. Such restraint can be difficult, especially when you want a particular view to be proved superior, but  restraint is an important characteristic of the critical thinker.




Exactly how much inquiry is enough depends entirely on the issue. In some cases, a brief inquiry will be more than adequate.  In others, an exhaustive inquiry will be incomplete. However, although no absolute statement can be made about the amount  of inquiry required, you can be reasonably sure your inquiries are complete when you have made a thorough and careful effort  to learn the relevant facts and to consult informed opinion in all fields of study that have a direct bearing on the specific issue  you are analyzing. The number of fields to be researched will, of course, vary with the nature of the issue. Here, for example,  is a list of the fields that have a direct bearing on three specific issues we identified in Chapter 16:
