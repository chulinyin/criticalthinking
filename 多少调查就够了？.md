> It would seem that deciding when an inquiry is complete should be easy. More often than not, however, it is not easy at all.  One insight can make a great difference. A single new fact can upset a mountain of evidence. For example, in the late 1960s  and early 1970s, most social psychologists probably would have agreed that crowded living conditions are harmful to humans.  Numerous experiments seemed to have settled the matter. Then anthropologist Patricia Draper studied a southwest African  tribe of hunter-gatherers, the !Kung bushmen. Though their land offers ample space to spread out their settlements and huts,  they crowd their dwellings together and often sit in tight groups, literally brushing against one another. Yet they have none of  the medical conditions \(such as high blood pressure\) usually associated with crowding.3 This one fact has caused reexamination of a scientific truism.

决定一个调查什么时候是完整的看起来应该很容易。然而， 往往， 这根本不容易。一次顿悟可以造成巨大的差别。一个新的事实可以推翻一座山的证据。例如：在20世纪60年代末和70年代初，大多数社会心理学家可能会同意，拥挤的生存条件对人类是有害的。无数的实验似乎已经确定了这个情况。然后人类学家 Patricia Draper 研究了一个西南非洲部落的原始人，昆布须曼人。尽管他们的土地提供了充足的空间来散布他们的居住区和小屋，他们还是把他们的住处聚集在一起，并经常坐在一个拥挤的人群中，真正地互相刷牙。然而他们没有任何通常与拥挤有关的医学疾病（如高血压）。这一个事实已经引起了科学真理的复审。

> Because the aim of inquiry is to produce evidence, it will be helpful to recall the guidelines presented in Chapter 6 for determining when evidence is sufficient:

因为调查的目的是产生证据，重申在第六章提出的指南可能是有帮助的， 确定证据什么时候是充足的。

> 1.Evidence is sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Wishing, assuming, or pretending that a judgment is correct does not constitute certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute. The standard for conviction in a criminal trial, for example, is “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Certainty is a very difficult standard to meet, especially in controversial issues, so you will generally be forced to settle for a more modest standard.

1.当证据允许可靠地作出一个判断时，证据就充足了。希望、假设或者假装一个判断是正确的,不构成必然性。必然性存在于没有充分的怀疑理由，没有争论的基础的时候。在刑事审判中的定罪标准，例如，是“超越合理怀疑”。必然性是一个很难满足的标准，特别是在有争议的问题中，所以你一般将被迫接受一个更加适中的标准。

> 2.If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability.  This means that the view in question is demonstrably more reasonable than any competing view. In civil court cases, this  standard is expressed as “a preponderance of the evidence.” Demonstrating reasonableness is, of course, very different  from merely asserting it, and all possible views must be identified and evaluated before any one view can be established as most reasonable.

2.如果必然性是达不到的，那么如果问题的一个观点被证明有可能性，则证据是充足的 。这意味着问题中的观点显然比竞争观点更合理。 在民事法庭案例 中，这个标准被称为“优势证据法则”。论证合理性当然与只是主张它非常不同，在建立任何一个最合理的的观点前，所有可能的观点都必须被确认和评估。

> 3.In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient. In other words, if the evidence does not show one view to be more reasonable than competing views, the only prudent course of action is to withhold judgment until sufficient  evidence is available. Such restraint can be difficult, especially when you want a particular view to be proved superior, but  restraint is an important characteristic of the critical thinker.

3.在所有其他情况中，证据必须被认为是不充分的。换句话说，如果证据不能表明一个观点比竞争观点更合理，唯一谨慎的处理方式就是保留判断，直到有充足的证据。这种克制可能是困难的，特别当你想要一个特别的观点被证明是优越的，但是克制是理性思维者的一个重要特征。

> Exactly how much inquiry is enough depends entirely on the issue. In some cases, a brief inquiry will be more than adequate.  In others, an exhaustive inquiry will be incomplete. However, although no absolute statement can be made about the amount  of inquiry required, you can be reasonably sure your inquiries are complete when you have made a thorough and careful effort  to learn the relevant facts and to consult informed opinion in all fields of study that have a direct bearing on the specific issue  you are analyzing. The number of fields to be researched will, of course, vary with the nature of the issue. Here, for example,  is a list of the fields that have a direct bearing on three specific issues we identified in Chapter 16:

到底多少调查是足够的完全取决于问题。在某些情况下，一个简短的调查就已经足够了。在其他情况下，一个详尽的调查将是不完整的。然而，虽然对调查需要的数量没有绝对的声明可以作，但是你可以合理地确信你的调查是完整的，当你已经做了一个彻底并且仔细的努力去学习有关的事实，去翻阅在各个对你正在分析的具体问题有直接关系的研究领域形成的观点。要研究领域的数量当然将随问题的性质而变化。这里，例如，是一个一个领域的列表，对我们在第16章中发现的三个具体问题有直接关系的领域的列表：

> issuse: Pornography’s influence
> 
> question: What attitudes does pornography cultivate toward love, marriage, and commitment? Does it, as some claim, celebrate the brutalization of women and glamorize rape? Does it make men see women as persons or as objects? Does it  elevate or degrade those who read\/view it?
> 
> field with direct bearing:  Sociology, Psychology, Literary criticism, Ethics Religion

问题： 色情文学的影响

疑问：色情文学对爱情、婚姻和承诺培养出了什么态度？它是否像有些人说的那样，庆祝妇女的残暴并美化强奸？它使男人把女人看作是人还是物？它是提高还是降低那些读\/看它的人？

直接相关领域：社会学、心里学、文学批评、伦理宗教。

issuse: Effects of being punched

question: Exactly what effect does a punch have on the human body, particularly the brain? What is the cumulative effect of the punches received  during ten or fifteen rounds of boxing? During a career?

field with direct bearing: Anatomy and physiology, Medicine \(especially neurology\), Psychology

问题：被拳击的影响

疑问：一个拳击到底对人的身体，特别是大脑有什么影响？在10轮或25轮拳击期间收到的拳打的累计影响时说明？在职业生涯期间呢？

直接相关领域：解剖与生理学、医学（特别是神经科）、心理学

issuse: The age of responsibility

question: Is it reasonable or fair to hold people responsible for their actions before they are old enough to understand the  moral and legal quality of those  actions? At what age does a person reach such understanding?

field with direct bearing:  Education, Psychology, Medicine, Ethics, Law

问题：责任年龄

疑问：在他们年纪大到理解这些行为的道德和法律的素质之前，让他们对他们的行为负责是合理或者公平的吗？一个人在什么年龄达到这样的理解。

> One of the greatest challenges to critical thinking is the temptation to stop inquiring when you find a knowledgeable person who supports your bias. The temptation will be especially strong when that person is the first one you encounter.  You will want to say, “This is the definitive answer. Case closed!” If you follow this inclination, you will trivialize the issue  and cheat yourself of genuine understanding. An issue is, by definition, a matter about which informed, careful thinkers  may disagree.

对理性思维最大的挑战之一是，当你发现一个知识渊博的人支持了你的偏见时，停止调查的诱惑。这种诱惑将会特别强烈，当那个人是你第一个遇见的人的时候。你会想说：这是明确的答案。结案！如果你按照这个倾向，你将轻视问题并且欺骗你自己的真正理解。根据定义，一个问题是指一个关于见多识广的、仔细的思想者可能会不同意的东西。

> A caution is in order here: To say that it is important to examine both sides of an issue does not mean that both sides are  equal in merit. Often there will be enough merit on each side to make judgment difficult, but that never justifies the avoidance of judgment.

这里的警告是：说检验一个问题的两方面是重要的，不意味着两方面是平等的。通常，每一方面都有足够的优点，会使判断变得困难，但这绝不是为了避免判断。
