> It would seem that deciding when an inquiry is complete should be easy. More often than not, however, it is not easy at all.  One insight can make a great difference. A single new fact can upset a mountain of evidence. For example, in the late 1960s  and early 1970s, most social psychologists probably would have agreed that crowded living conditions are harmful to humans.  Numerous experiments seemed to have settled the matter. Then anthropologist Patricia Draper studied a southwest African  tribe of hunter-gatherers, the !Kung bushmen. Though their land offers ample space to spread out their settlements and huts,  they crowd their dwellings together and often sit in tight groups, literally brushing against one another. Yet they have none of  the medical conditions \(such as high blood pressure\) usually associated with crowding.3 This one fact has caused reexamination of a scientific truism.

决定一个调查什么时候是完整的看起来应该很容易。然而， 往往， 这根本不容易。一次顿悟可以造成巨大的差别。一个新的事实可以推翻一座山的证据。例如：在20世纪60年代末和70年代初，大多数社会心理学家可能会同意，拥挤的生存条件对人类是有害的。无数的实验似乎已经确定了这个情况。然后人类学家 Patricia Draper 研究了一个西南非洲部落的原始人，昆布须曼人。尽管他们的土地提供了充足的空间来散布他们的居住区和小屋，他们还是把他们的住处聚集在一起，并经常坐在一个拥挤的人群中，真正地互相刷牙。然而他们没有任何通常与拥挤有关的医学疾病（如高血压）。这一个事实已经引起了科学真理的复审

> Because the aim of inquiry is to produce evidence, it will be helpful to recall the guidelines presented in Chapter 6 for determining when evidence is sufficient:

因为调查的目的是产生证据，重申在第六章提出的指南可能是有帮助的， 确定证据什么时候是充足的。

1. Evidence is sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Wishing, assuming, or pretending that a judgment is correct does not constitute certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute. The standard for conviction in a criminal trial, for example, is “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Certainty is a very difficult standard to meet, especially in controversial issues, so you will generally be forced to settle for a more modest standard.

2. If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability.  This means that the view in question is demonstrably more reasonable than any competing view. In civil court cases, this  standard is expressed as “a preponderance of the evidence.” Demonstrating reasonableness is, of course, very different  from merely asserting it, and all possible views must be identified and evaluated before any one view can be established as most reasonable.

3. In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient. In other words, if the evidence does not show one view to be more reasonable than competing views, the only prudent course of action is to withhold judgment until sufficient  evidence is available. Such restraint can be difficult, especially when you want a particular view to be proved superior, but  restraint is an important characteristic of the critical thinker.


Exactly how much inquiry is enough depends entirely on the issue. In some cases, a brief inquiry will be more than adequate.  In others, an exhaustive inquiry will be incomplete. However, although no absolute statement can be made about the amount  of inquiry required, you can be reasonably sure your inquiries are complete when you have made a thorough and careful effort  to learn the relevant facts and to consult informed opinion in all fields of study that have a direct bearing on the specific issue  you are analyzing. The number of fields to be researched will, of course, vary with the nature of the issue. Here, for example,  is a list of the fields that have a direct bearing on three specific issues we identified in Chapter 16:
