We can achieve knowledge either actively or passively. We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea \(as in a scientific experiment\), or by reasoning. When we do it by reasoning, we analyze a problem, consider all the facts and possible interpretations, and draw the logical conclusion.

我们能主动或者被动地获得知识。我们通过直接的经验，通过检测和证明一个观点（如同在科学实验中）或者通过推理来主动地获得知识。当我们通过推理来做时，我们分析问题，考虑所有事实和可能的解释，并得出符合逻辑的结论。

We achieve knowledge passively by being told something by someone else. Most of the learning that takes place in the classroom and the kind that happens when we watch TV news reports or read newspapers or magazines is passive. Conditioned as we are to passive learning, it’s not surprising that we depend on it in our everyday communication with friends and coworkers.

我们通过被他人告知某些事情而被动地获得知识。大多数发生在教室，发生在看电视新闻报道，阅读报纸或者杂志时的学习都是被动的。因为我们习惯于被动学习，所以我们在与朋友和同事的日常交流中依赖它也就不奇怪了。

Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious defect. It makes us tend to accept uncritically what we are told even when what we are told is little more than hearsay and rumor.

不幸的是，被动学习有一个严重的缺陷。它使我们倾向于不加批判地接受我们被告知的东西，即使那只是传闻和谣言。

Did you ever play the game Rumor \(or Telephone\)? It begins when one person writes down a message but doesn’t show it to anyone. Then the person whispers it, word for word, to another person. That person, in turn, whispers it to still another, and so on, through all the people playing the game. The last person writes down the message word for word as he or she hears it. Then the two written statements are compared. Typically, the original message has changed, often dramatically, in passing from person to person.

你曾玩过传字（或者电话）游戏吗？它开始于一个人写下一条信息，但是不能给任何人看。接着此人一字不变地把它耳语给另一个人，而那个人转而耳语给下一个人……如此传给所有玩游戏的人。最后一个人逐字写下他／她听到的信息。然后比较两条信息。通常原来的信息在从一个人传给另一个人的过程中戏剧性地变了，

That’s what happens in daily life. No two words have precisely the same shades of meaning. Therefore, the simple fact that people repeat a story in their own words rather than in exact quotation changes the story. Then, too, most people listen imperfectly. And many enjoy adding their own creative touch to a story, trying to improve on it by stamping it with their own personal style. This tendency may be conscious or unconscious. Yet the effect is the same in either case—those who hear it think they know.

这就是日常生活中发生的事情。没有两个词具有完全相同的意思。因此，一个简单的事实——人们用自己的话而不是确切的引用来复述故事，改变了整个故事。还有，大多数人听得并不完美。许多人喜欢把自己创造性的修饰加到故事中，试图通过他们个人的风格改进它。这种倾向可能是有意识或者无意识的。然而，不论哪种情况，对于那些听到并自以为知道的人来说结果是一样的。

This process is not limited to everyday exchanges among people. It is also found among scholars and authors: “A statement of opinion by one writer may be restated as a fact by another, who may in turn be quoted as an authority by yet another; and this process may continue indefinitely, unless it occurs to someone to question the facts on which the original writer based his opinion or to challenge the interpretation he placed upon those facts.”10

这个过程不仅限于人们之间的日常交流。它还被发现于学术和学者中：“一个作者的观点陈述可能被另一个作者作为事实重述，而他还可能转而被另一个作者作为一个权威引用；并且这个过程可能会无限继续下去，除非有人质疑作为原作者观点基础的事实，或者挑他对这些事实的理解。”
