> Even when our perception is initially flawless, our memory often distorts the data. We forget details, and when later attempting to recall what hap-pened we resort to imagination to fill in the blanks. Though we may at first be aware that such a process of reconstruction is occurring, this awareness soon fades, and we come to believe we are remembering the original perception. As psychologist William James explained,

即使我们的感知起初是完美的，我们的记忆经常歪曲数据。我们忘记细节，并在之后试图回顾发生了什么的时候，我们斥诸想象力去填补空白。虽然开始我们可能意识到这种重构过程正在发生，但这个意识很快消失，我们开始相信我们正在记忆最初的感觉。正如心理学家 William James 所说，

* > The most frequent source of false memory is the accounts we give to others of our experiences. Such acts we almost always make more simple and more interesting than the truth. We quote what we should have said or done rather than what we really said or did; and in the first telling we may be fully aware of the distinction, but \[before\] long the fiction expels the reality from memory and \[replaces it\]. We think of what we wish had happened,of possible \[interpretations\] of acts, and soon we are unable to distinguish between things that actually happened and our own thoughts about what might have occurred. Our wishes, hopes, and sometimes fears are the controlling factor.3

  最常见的错误记忆来源是我们给别人的我们经历的描述。我们几乎总是使这种行为比真相更简单和更有趣。我们引用我们本应该说或做的，而不是我们真正说的或者做的；在第一次叙述中我们可能完全意识到两者的区别，但是不久之后假象将现实从记忆中驱逐并替代了它。我们想我们期望发生的，想对行为的可能解释，很快我们不能区分实际发生的与我们自己想象可能已经发生的。我们的期望、希望和有时的恐惧是控制因素。


> As if this weren’t enough, memory is vulnerable to contamination from outside the mind. Memory expert Elizabeth Loftus showed children a one-minute film and then asked, “Did you see a bear?” or “Did you seea boat?” They remembered seeing them, even though no bears or boats were in the film. She also showed adults a film of an auto accident andthen asked them about it. By using the word “smash” instead of “hit,” she was able to change the viewers’ estimate of the cars’ speed and to create a memory of broken glass where there was none. In another experiment,Loftus asked the parents of college students to describe some events from their sons’ and daughters’ childhoods. Then she talked with each student about those events but added a fake event or two. With only slight coaxing, the students “remembered” the fake events, were able to elaborate on the details, and in some cases refused to believe they were fake even when Loftus explained what she had done.4

好像这还不够，记忆还易受外界污染。记忆专家 Elizabeth Loftus 给孩子们看了一部一分钟电影，接着问，“你有看到一只熊吗？”或者“你有看到船吗？”他们记得看到过它们，即使电影中没有熊或者船。她还给成年人看了一部车祸电影，接着问他们。通过使用单词“smash（粉碎）”代替“hit（击中）”， 她能改变观看者对汽车速度的估计并能创建一个电影中没有的破碎玻璃的记忆。在另一个实验中， Loftus 要求大学生的父母描述她们儿子和女儿的一些童年往事。接着她和每个学生谈论这些事情，但是增加一两个假冒的事情。仅用了轻微的引诱，学生们居然“记得”假冒的事件，并能详细阐述细节，并在某些情况下拒绝相信它们是假的，即使当 Loftus 解释她做了什么的时候。
