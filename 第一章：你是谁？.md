> Suppose someone asked, “Who are you?” It would be simple enough to respond with your name. But if the person wanted to  know the entire story about who you are, the question would be more difficult to answer. You’d obviously have to give the  details of your height, age, and weight. You’d also have to include all your sentiments and preferences, even the secret ones  you’ve never shared with anyone—your affection for your loved ones; your desire to please the people you associate with;  your dislike of your older sister’s husband; your allegiance to your favorite beverage, brand of clothing, and music.

假设有人问，“你是谁？”用你名字回答即可。但是如果他想知道关于你是谁的完整故事，这个问题将变得更难回答。你显然必须给出你的身高、年龄、和体重的细节。你还必须包括你所有的观点和喜好，甚至你从未分享给别人的秘密————你对你亲人的爱；你对取悦与你交往的人的渴望；你对你姐夫的不喜欢；你对你最喜爱的饮料、衣服品牌和音乐的忠诚。

> Your attitudes couldn’t be overlooked either—your impatience when an issue gets complex, your aversion to certain courses,  your fear of high places and dogs and speaking in public. The list would go on. To be complete, it would have to include all  your characteristics—not only the physical but also the emotional and intellectual.

你的态度也不容忽视——当一个问题变得复杂时你的不耐心，你对某些课程的厌恶，你的对高地、狗和公开发言的恐惧。这个名单将继续。为了完整，它将必须包括你的所有特点——不仅是有形的，还有情感和智商。

> To provide all that information would be quite a chore. But suppose the questioner was still curious and asked, “How did you  get the way you are?” If your patience were not yet exhausted, chances are you’d answer something like this: “I’m this way  because I choose to be, because I’ve considered other sentiments and preferences and attitudes and have made my  selections. The ones I have chosen fit my style and personality best.” That answer is natural enough, and in part it’s true. But  in a larger sense, it’s not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than most of us realize.

提供所有这些信息将相当麻烦。但是假设提问者仍然好奇，并问，“你怎样得到你现在的样子的？”如果你的耐心还没有耗尽，可能你会这样回答：“我是这样，是因为我选择成为这样，是因为我已经考虑过其他的观点、喜好和态度，并做出了我的选择。我选择了最适合我的风格和个性。”那个回答是很自然的，一部分是真的。但是在更大的意义上，这不是真的。世界对我们的影响远远大于我们大多数人意识到的。
