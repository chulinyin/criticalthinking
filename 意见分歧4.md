> The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. Afterreading the statement, use the library and/or the Internet and find whatknowledgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain howyou reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct a view of your own that combines the insights from all views and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or an oral report, as your instructor specifies.

下面一段文章总结了一个重要的不同意见。在阅读该陈述之后，使用图书馆和互联网，寻找知识渊博的人关于这个问题说了什么。确保覆盖了整个范围的观点。然后评价每个观点的优缺点。如果你推断一个观点是完全正确的，而其他观点是错误的，解释你是如何得到这个结论的。更可能的情况是，你发现一个观点比其它观点更富有洞察力，但是它们都有一些正确的点，则结合所有观点的见解，构造一个你自己的观点，并解释为什么这个观点是所有观点中最合理的。按照你老师的指定，在一个书面或者口头报告中展示你的回答。

* > Who is responsible for the fiscal crisis of 2008? This issue continues to be central to overcoming the consequences of the crisis and to ensuring that it does not recur. Commentators are divided on the cause. Some claim it is was the policies of George W. Bush’s administration; others, the policies of the Clinton administration; others, the greed of Wall Street executives. Many point, instead, to congressional pressure on banks, during the 1990s, to give loans to people who could not afford to repay them. Still others say the crisis originated during the Carter administration, specifically in the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.

  谁该为2008年的财政危机负责？这个问题继续成为克服危机的结果并确保它不会复发的核心。评论员在原因上产生了分歧。一些人声称这是布什政府的政策；其他人认为是克林顿政府的政策；还有人认为，是华尔街高管的贪污。许多观点，取而代之，认为是国会对银行的压力，在20世纪90年代期间，借款给那些偿还不起它们的人。仍然有些人说危机起源于卡特政府期间，特别是在1997年的社区再投资法案中。
