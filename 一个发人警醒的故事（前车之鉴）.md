> Even authorities who have the most sophisticated measurement tools at their disposal fail to achieve certainty. Consider, for example, the challenge to anthropologists posed by the Tasaday tribe. When discovered on the Philippine island of Mindanao in the late 1960s, the Tasaday were living a Stone Age existence—inhabiting caves in the deep jungle, ignorant of agriculture, subsisting by hunting and gathering. Manuel Elizaldo, an associate of then dictator Ferdinand Marcos, quickly became their protector, mentor, and go-between with a fascinated world. A number of anthropologists and other experts visited the tribe and studied their artifacts,language, and social structure. Except for a few skeptics, most scholars judged them to be authentic Stone Age people. Prestigious publications like National Geographic wrote about the Tasaday and marveled at the fact that they were such an innocent, gentle people with no words in their language for “weapon,” “war,” or “hostility.”

即使是拥有最精密测量工具的专家们也无法实现确定性。例如，考虑塔沙地人部落对人类学家构成的挑战。在20世纪60年代末，当塔沙地人在菲律宾的棉兰老岛上被发现时，他们正以石器时代的生活方式生存——居住于丛林深处的洞穴里，不了解农业，通过打猎和采集维持生活。 当时独裁者 Ferdinand Marcos 的一个伙伴 Manuel Elizaldo ，很快成为了他们的保护者、导师以及与迷人世界之间的中间人。许多人类学家和其它专家拜访了这个部落，研究他们的工艺品、语言和社会结构。除了一些怀疑者，大多数学者判断他们是正宗的石器时代的人。像“国家地理”这种有声望的出版社撰写了关于塔沙地人的文章，并对他们如此地天真无邪的事实（在他们的语言中没有“武器”、“战争”或者“敌意”）感到惊讶。

> In 1986, after the Marcos regime collapsed, a Swiss journalist visited the Tasaday and found them living in houses. They reportedly admitted to him that their story was an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Elizaldo. He supposedly told them when to go to the caves and put on the Stone Age act for visiting journalists and scholars. Elizaldo has denied the charge and has had the continuing support of many scientists. Douglas Yen, an ethnobiologist and early Tasaday researcher, originally sought to link the group to neighboring farming tribes, but he now believes the Stone Age circumstances were genuine. \(He cites a case in which little children were shown cultivated rice and displayed amazement.\) Carol Molony, a linguist and another early Tasaday scholar, is also a believer. She argues that the tribe, children as well as adults, would have to have been superb actors to eliminate all agricultural metaphors from their speech. A local priest and former skeptic, Fr. Sean McDonagh, also believes the Tasaday to be authentic and says neighboring tribes do too.

1986年，在马科斯（Marcos）政权倒塌后，一个瑞士的新闻记者访问了塔沙地人，发现他们居住在房子里。据说他们向他承认他们的故事是由 Elizaldo 精心编造的一个骗局。据说他告诉他们什么时候去洞穴，以及为访问的记者和学者假装石器时代的行为。Elizaldo 否认了这项控告，还继续得到了许多科学家的支持。一位早期塔沙地人的研究者，人类学家道格拉斯日元（Douglas Yen），起初试图把这个群体与邻近的农业部落联系到一起，但是他现在相信石器时代的情况是真实的。（他引用了一个案例，其中小孩子被看到在耕种水稻，并表现出惊奇。）另一个早期塔沙地人的研究者，语言学家卡罗尔·马勒尼（Carol Molony），也是一个信徒。她认为塔沙地人部落的小孩和成人都必须是极好的演员才能从他们的言语中排出所有农业的隐喻。一位当地的祭祀，以前的怀疑者 Fr·肖恩麦多纳（Fr. Sean McDonagh）也相信塔沙地人是真的，并说相邻的部落也这样做。

One continuing element of dispute concerns the authenticity of Tasadaytools. Zeus Salazar, a Philippine anthropologist, maintains that the loosestraps attaching stones to handles suggest a poor attempt to fake StoneAge methods. Yet archaeologist Ian Glover says such looseness has beennoted in authentic Stone Age implements. The Tasaday’s own statementshave not simplified the puzzle. They told NBC and Philippine television that their original story was true and then told ABC and British televisionthat it was false.

How likely is it that any outside observer knows the real story aboutthe Tasaday, in all its complexity? Not very. That is why, in this and simi-larly difficult cases, responsible people do not claim to know what hap-pened. Instead, they speak of what it is most plausible to believehappened, in light of the evidence. That is how anthropologist ThomasHeadland, who exhaustively researched the Tasaday case, speaks of it.He suggests that there was probably no hoax but that there were grossexaggerations and false media reports, as well as some self-fulfillingexpectations by anthropologists. It is likely, he believes, that the Tasadaywere once members of the neighboring farming tribes who fled severalhundred years ago \(perhaps to avoid slave traders\) and who hid in theforest for so many generations that they not only regressed to a Stone Ageculture but lost all memory of their more advanced state.19
