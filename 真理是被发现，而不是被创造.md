> Let’s review what our evaluation has revealed. First, our ideas and beliefs are unavoidably influenced by other people’s, particularly in childhood.Second, perception and memory are imperfect. Third, our information can be inaccurate or incomplete. Add to this the fact, noted in Chapter 2,that some people’s thinking skills are woefully meager and/or ineffectively used, and the idea that “everyone creates his or her own truth”becomes laughable. We do create something, all right, but it is not truth. It is beliefs, ideas that we accept as true but that could easily be false.

让我们回顾一下我们评估的结果。第一，我们的想法和信念不可避免地受他人影响，特别是在童年时期。第二，知觉和记忆是有缺陷的。第三，我们的信息可能不准确或者不完整。再加上，第二章指出，一些人的思维技能是严重贫乏和／或者被无效使用，于是“每个人创造他／她自己的真理”变得荒唐可笑。好吧，我们确实创造了一些东西，但是那不是真理。那是信念，我们接受的想法是真实的，但是它很容易是错的。

> What, then, is the most reasonable view of truth? The truth about something is what is so about it—the facts in their exact arrangement and proportions. Our beliefs and assertions are true when they correspond to that reality and false when they do not.

那么，最合理的真理观是什么呢？关于某事的真理是指什么是什么——在它们确切的约定和部分中的事实。当我们的信念和主张与事实相符的时候是真的，否则，是假的。

> Did time run out before the basketball player got the shot off? How does gravity work? Who stole your hubcaps? Are there time/space limits to the universe? Who started the argument between you and your neigh-bor last weekend? Have you been working up to your potential in this course? To look for the truth in such matters is to look for the answer thatfits the facts, the correct answer.

在篮球运动员投篮之前时间用完了吗？重力是如何工作的？谁偷了你的轮毂？宇宙有时间/空间限制吗？上周末，你和你的邻居谁开始了争论？你有在这门课程中一直努力发展你的潜力吗？在这种事情中寻找真理是寻找那些符合事实的答案，正确的答案。

> Truth is apprehended by discovery, a process that favors the curious and the diligent. Truth does not depend on our acknowledgment of it,nor is it in any way altered by our ignorance or transformed by our wishful thinking. King Tut’s tomb did not spring into existence when archaeologists dug it up; it was there waiting to be discovered. Art forgeries are not genuine when people are fooled and then fake when the deception is revealed. Cigarette smoking is not rendered harmless to our health because we would prefer it to be so.

真理被发现所捕捉，这是一个有利于好奇和勤奋的过程。真理不取决于我们对它的认可，也不会因我们的忽视而以任何方式改变，或者因我们渴望的想法而转变。 当考古学家挖出国王 Tut 的坟墓的时候，它不会突然存在；它在那里等待被发现。当人被欺骗时，艺术伪造品不是真的，接着当欺骗被揭露时，它是赝品。吸烟没有被渲染成对我们的健康是无害的，因为我们更喜欢它是这样的。

> Much of the confusion about truth arises from complex situations inwhich the truth is difficult to ascertain or express. Consider a question like Are there really UFOs that are piloted by extraterrestrial beings? Although the question is often hotly debated and people make assertions that purport to express the truth, there is not yet sufficient evidence to say we know the truth about UFOs. However, that doesn’t mean there is no truth about them or that people who affirm their existence and people who deny it are equally correct. It means that whatever the truth is, we do not yet possess it.

关于真理的许多困惑源于真理难以查明或者表达的复杂情况。考虑一个问题，如真的有被外星生物驾驶的 UFO 吗？虽然这个问题经常被热烈地讨论，人们宣称要表达真理， 然而还没有足够的证据说我们知道关于 UFO 的真相。然而，那不意味着关于它们没有真理或者断言它们存在的人和拒绝它的人都是正确的。这意味着，不论真理是什么，我们还没有拥有它。

> Similar difficulty arises from many psychological and philosophical questions—for example: Why are some people heterosexual and others homosexual? Is the cause of criminality genetic or environmental or a combination of the two? Are humans inherently violent? Is there an after-life? What constitutes success? The answers to these questions, and to many of the issues you will encounter in the applications in this book,will often be incomplete or tentative. Yet that fact should not shake your conviction that there are truths to be discovered.

类似的困难源于许多心理学和哲学的问题，例如：为什么一些人异性恋而其他人同性恋？犯罪的原因是基因还是环境，还是两者的混合？人类本身是暴力的吗？有死后吗？什么构成了成功？这些问题以及许多你会在本书应用中遇到的问题的答案，将通常是不完整的或者暂定的。然而，这个事实不应该动摇你“有真理要被发现”的信念。

> When planes crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, killing several thousand people,the event was officially classified as a terrorist attack. But before long, a very different theory was advanced—that individuals in the highest levels of the U.S. government had planned and executed the crashes to provide an excuse for attacking Iraq. This conspiracy theory gained a number of well-known supporters, including movie and television stars and at least one member of Congress, and was disseminated around the world. In France, for example, a book supporting the theory became a best-seller.The issue became the subject of international debate—in some quarters,people are still divided in their views. But to my knowledge, not a single individual, in this country or abroad, took the position that both views are correct—that is, that each side is entitled to its own truth. If anyone had, he or she would have been attacked by both camps for talking nonsense and trivializing an important issue. When it comes to significant events like9/11, people want to know the truth, what really happened.

2011年9月11日，当飞机撞上世界贸易中心和五角大楼的双塔时，造成了数千人的死亡，这个事件被官方列为恐怖袭击事件。但是不久之后，一个非常不同的理论被提出了——美国政府的最高层的人计划并执行了事故，为攻击伊拉克提供了一个借口。这个阴谋论获得了一些知名的支持者，包括电影和电视明星以及至少一位国会成员，并在全球传播。例如，在法国，一本支持这个理论的书成为了畅销书。这个问题成了国际讨论的主题——在某些方面，人们仍然被以他们的观点划分。但据我所知，没有一个人在这个国家或者国外采取了两个观点都是正确的立场——也就是说，每一方都有权获得它自己的真理。如果任何人获得了，他／她将会被两边谈论废话和轻视一个重要问题的人所攻击。当谈及重要的事件像9.11，人们想要知道真相，真正发生了什么？

> Having the right frame of mind can make your pursuit of the truth less burdensome and give it the sense of adventure that the great thinkers in history experienced. A good way to begin is to keep the following thought in mind: “I know I have limitations and can easily be mistaken. And surely I’ll never find all the answers I’d like to. But I can observe a little more accurately, weigh things a little more thoroughly, and make up my mind alittle more carefully. If I do so, I’ll be a little closer to the truth.”

拥有正确的思维框架可以让你对真理的追求不那么繁重，并给予它一种伟大思想家在历史中所经历的冒险的感觉。一个好的开端是在脑中保持下面的想法：“我知道我有局限性且容易犯错。并且我肯定永远无法找到所有我想要的答案。但是我可以观察得更精确一点，衡量事情更完全一点，做决定更小心一点。这样一来，我将离真理更近一点。”

> That’s far different from saying, “Everyone makes his or her own truth”or “It all depends on how you look at it.” And it is much more reasonable.

这和说，“每个人有他或她自己的真理”或者“这完全取决于你怎么看它”远远不同。并且，它更合理。
