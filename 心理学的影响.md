The social and psychological theories of our time also have an impact on our beliefs. Before the past few decades, people  were urged to be selfdisciplined, self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice selfdenial, to aspire to self- knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice. “Hard  work,” they were told, “leads to achievement, and that in turn produces satisfaction and self-confidence.” By and large, our  grandparents internalized those teachings. When they honored them in their behavior, they felt proud; when they dishonored  them, they felt ashamed. 

Today the theories have been changed—indeed, almost exactly reversed. Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce defined as “an erroneous appraisement,” is now considered an imperative. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with “a disease to please.” The formula for success and happiness begins with feeling  good about ourselves. Students who do poorly in school, workers who don’t measure up to the challenges of their jobs,  substance abusers, lawbreakers—all are typically diagnosed as deficient in self-esteem.

 In addition, just as our grandparents  internalized the social and psychological theories of their time, so most contemporary Americans have internalized the  message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over coffee; we hear it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challenges to its  precepts are usually met with disapproval. 

But isn’t the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No. A negative perception of our abilities will, of course, handicap our  performance. Dr. Maxwell Maltz explains the amazing results one educator had in improving the grades of schoolchildren by  changing their self-images. The educator had observed that when the children saw themselves as stupid in a particular subject  \(or stupid in general\), they unconsciously acted to confirm their self-images. They believed they were stupid, so they acted that  way. Reasoning that it was their defeatist attitude rather than any lack of ability that was undermining their efforts, the educator

set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished that, they no longer behaved stupidly! Maltz concludes from this and other examples that our experiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us, suggesting a conclusion about ourselves and then urging us to make it come true.21

Many proponents of self-esteem went far beyond Maltz’s demonstration that self-confidence is an important ingredient in  success. They claimed that there is no such thing as too much self-esteem. Research does not support that claim. For  example, Martin Seligman, an eminent research psychologist and founder of the movement known as positive psychology, cites significant evidence that, rather than solving personal and social problems, including depression, the modern emphasis  on selfesteem causes them.22

Maltz’s research documents that lack of confidence impedes performance, a valuable insight. But such research doesn’t  explain why the more global concept of self-esteem has become so dominant. The answer to that question lies in the  popularization of the work of humanistic psychologists such as Abraham Maslow. Maslow described what he called the hierarchy of human needs in the form of a pyramid, with physiological needs \(food and drink\) at the foundation. Above them, in  ascending order, are safety needs, the need for belongingness and love, the need for esteem and approval, and aesthetic and  cognitive needs \(knowledge, understanding, etc.\). At the pinnacle is the need for self-actualization, or fulfillment of our  potential. In Maslow’s view, the lower needs must be fulfilled before the higher ones. It’s easy to see how the idea that  selfesteem must precede achievement was derived from Maslow’s theory.

Other theories might have been adopted, however. A notable one is Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl’s, which was advanced  at roughly the same time as Maslow’s and was based on both Frankl’s professional practice and his experiences in Hitler’s concentration camps. Frankl argues that one human need is higher than self-actualization: self-transcendence, the need to  rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, “the primordial anthropological fact \[is\] that being human is being  always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love.” A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself and giving himself,  overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

Making self-actualization \(or happiness\) the direct object of our pursuit, in Frankl’s view, is ultimately self-defeating; such fulfillment can occur only as “the unintended effect of self-transcendence.”23 The proper perspective on life, Frankl believes, is  not what it can give to us, but what it expects from us; life is daily—even hourly—questioning us, challenging us to accept “the  responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for \[each of us\].”24 

Finding meaning, according to Frankl’s theory, involves “perceiving a possibility embedded in reality” and searching for  challenging tasks “whose completion might add meaning to \[one’s\] existence.” But such perceiving and searching are  frustrated by the focus on self: “As long as modern literature confines itself to, and contents itself with, self-expression—not to  say self-exhibition—it reflects its authors’ sense of futility and absurdity. What is more important, it also creates absurdity. This is understandable in light of the fact that meaning must be discovered, it cannot be invented. Sense cannot be created, but what may well be created is nonsense.”25

Whether we agree completely with Frankl, one thing is clear: Contemporary American culture would be markedly different if the  emphasis over the past several decades had been on Frankl’s theory rather than on the theories of Maslow and the other  humanistic psychologists. All of us would have been affected—we can only imagine how profoundly—in our attitudes, values, and beliefs.
