> The social and psychological theories of our time also have an impact on our beliefs. Before the past few decades, people  were urged to be selfdisciplined, self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice selfdenial, to aspire to self- knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice. “Hard  work,” they were told, “leads to achievement, and that in turn produces satisfaction and self-confidence.” By and large, our  grandparents internalized those teachings. When they honored them in their behavior, they felt proud; when they dishonored  them, they felt ashamed.

我们时代的社会学和心理学理论也对我们的信念有影响。在过去几十年前，人们被敦促要自律、自我批评、谦卑。他们被敦促练习自我否定、渴望自我了解、以一种确保他们保持自尊的方式行事。自我为中心被认为是一种罪恶。“努力工作，”他们被告知，“带来成就，那反过来又产生满足和自信。”总的来说，我们的祖父母内化了这些教育。当他们在行为尊重它们时，他们感到骄傲；当他们羞辱它们时，他们感到羞耻。

> Today the theories have been changed—indeed, almost exactly reversed. Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce defined as “an erroneous appraisement,” is now considered an imperative. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with “a disease to please.” The formula for success and happiness begins with feeling  good about ourselves. Students who do poorly in school, workers who don’t measure up to the challenges of their jobs,  substance abusers, lawbreakers—all are typically diagnosed as deficient in self-esteem.

今天理论已经发生改变——实际上，几乎完全相反。 自尊，被19世纪讽刺作家 Ambrose Bierce 定义为“一个错误的评价，”，现在被认为是必须的。自我为中心已经从罪恶变为美德，那些致力于帮助他人的人，曾被认为是英雄和圣人，现在被说成是得了“取悦病”。成功和幸福准则始于自我感觉良好。在学校表现得不好的学生们，不能应付工作挑战的工人们，滥用药物者，不法分子——都被通常被诊断为缺乏自尊。

> In addition, just ”as our grandparents  internalized the social and psychological theories of their time, so most contemporary Americans have internalized the  message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over coffee; we hear it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challenges to its  precepts are usually met with disapproval.

另外，就像我们的祖父母在他们的时代内化社会学和心理学理论，因此大多数当代美国人已经内化了自尊的信息。我们听人们在咖啡厅谈论它；我们听到它在脱口秀中被无尽地引用。挑战它的戒律通常会遭到反对。

> But isn’t the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No. A negative perception of our abilities will, of course, handicap our  performance. Dr. Maxwell Maltz explains the amazing results one educator had in improving the grades of schoolchildren by  changing their self-images. The educator had observed that when the children saw themselves as stupid in a particular subject  \(or stupid in general\), they unconsciously acted to confirm their self-images. They believed they were stupid, so they acted that  way. Reasoning that it was their defeatist attitude rather than any lack of ability that was undermining their efforts, the educator set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished that, they no longer behaved stupidly! Maltz concludes from this and other examples that our experiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us, suggesting a conclusion about ourselves and then urging us to make it come true.21

但是自尊的理论不是不言而喻的吗？ 不。对我们能力的负面看法，当然会阻碍我们的表现。 Maxwell Maltz 博士解释了一个教育家通过改变学生的自我画像提高他们的成绩的惊人结果。教育家观察到，当孩子们在一个特定的主题中认为自己是愚蠢的（或者总体上是愚蠢的），他们不自觉地表现，以巩固他们的自我画像。他们认为他们是愚蠢的，所以用那种方式表现。推断出， 妨碍他们努力的是他们失败主义的态度而不是缺乏能力，教育家开始着手改变他们的自我画像。他发现当他完成的时候，他们不再表现得愚蠢。Maltz 从这个和其他例子推断出，我们的经历可以对我们产生一种自我催眠， 暗示一个关于我们自己的结论，接着敦促我们去实现它。

> Many proponents of self-esteem went far beyond Maltz’s demonstration that self-confidence is an important ingredient in  success. They claimed that there is no such thing as too much self-esteem. Research does not support that claim. For  example, Martin Seligman, an eminent research psychologist and founder of the movement known as positive psychology, cites significant evidence that, rather than solving personal and social problems, including depression, the modern emphasis  on selfesteem causes them.22

许多自尊的拥护者远远超出了 Maltz 的论证， 自信是成功的一个重要因素。他们声称没有东西是过于自尊的。研究者不支持那个主张。例如， 一个著名研究心理学家和被称为积极心理学的创始人 Martin Seligman ， 提出了重要的证据，`现代对自尊的强调导致了他们患上抑郁症，而不是解决了个人和社会问题`。

> Maltz’s research documents that lack of confidence impedes performance, a valuable insight. But such research doesn’t  explain why the more global concept of self-esteem has become so dominant. The answer to that question lies in the  popularization of the work of humanistic psychologists such as Abraham Maslow. Maslow described what he called the hierarchy of human needs in the form of a pyramid, with physiological needs \(food and drink\) at the foundation. Above them, in  ascending order, are safety needs, the need for belongingness and love, the need for esteem and approval, and aesthetic and  cognitive needs \(knowledge, understanding, etc.\). At the pinnacle is the need for self-actualization, or fulfillment of our  potential. In Maslow’s view, the lower needs must be fulfilled before the higher ones. It’s easy to see how the idea that  selfesteem must precede achievement was derived from Maslow’s theory.

Maltz 的研究证明缺少自信阻碍表现，是一个有价值的洞察。但是这样的研究没有解释为什么更全面的自尊概念已变得如此占主导地位？这个问题的答案在于像 Abraham Maslow 这样的人文心理家的作品的普及。 Maslow 用一个金字塔的形式描述了他所说的人类需求的层次结构， 生理需求（食物和饮料）在最底层 。在它们之上是安全需求、归属感和爱情需求、尊重和认可需求、审美和认知需求（知识、理解等）。最高处是自我实现或实现我们潜力的需求。在 Maslow 的看来，较低的需求必须在较高的需求之前实现。很容易看出，自尊必须先于成就的想法是从 Masolw 的理论推导出来的。

> Other theories might have been adopted, however. A notable one is Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl’s, which was advanced  at roughly the same time as Maslow’s and was based on both Frankl’s professional practice and his experiences in Hitler’s concentration camps. Frankl argues that one human need is higher than self-actualization: self-transcendence, the need to  rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, “the primordial anthropological fact \[is\] that being human is being  always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love.” A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself and giving himself,  overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

然而，其他理论可能已被采纳。一个值得注意的是澳大利亚的心理学家 Viktor Frankl 的理论，被提出的时间大致和 Maslow 的理论一样，基于 Frankl 的专业实践和他在希特勒集中营里的经历。 Frankl 认为一个高于自我实现的人类需求是：自我超越，超越狭窄的自我吸收。根据 Frankl ，“原始的人类学事实是人类总是被指导和指向某些东西或某些人除了自己：为了一个意义的实现，或者另一个人的相遇，服务事业服务或者一个人的爱。”一个人“通过忘记自己并给予自己，俯瞰自己并关注外部世界” 成为完整的人。 

Making self-actualization \(or happiness\) the direct object of our pursuit, in Frankl’s view, is ultimately self-defeating; such fulfillment can occur only as “the unintended effect of self-transcendence.”23 The proper perspective on life, Frankl believes, is  not what it can give to us, but what it expects from us; life is daily—even hourly—questioning us, challenging us to accept “the  responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for \[each of us\].”24

Finding meaning, according to Frankl’s theory, involves “perceiving a possibility embedded in reality” and searching for  challenging tasks “whose completion might add meaning to \[one’s\] existence.” But such perceiving and searching are  frustrated by the focus on self: “As long as modern literature confines itself to, and contents itself with, self-expression—not to  say self-exhibition—it reflects its authors’ sense of futility and absurdity. What is more important, it also creates absurdity. This is understandable in light of the fact that meaning must be discovered, it cannot be invented. Sense cannot be created, but what may well be created is nonsense.”25

Whether we agree completely with Frankl, one thing is clear: Contemporary American culture would be markedly different if the  emphasis over the past several decades had been on Frankl’s theory rather than on the theories of Maslow and the other  humanistic psychologists. All of us would have been affected—we can only imagine how profoundly—in our attitudes, values, and beliefs.
