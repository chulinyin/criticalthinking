> The word argument has several meanings, so our first task is to clarify each and note how it differs from the others. One common meaning is “a quarrel,” as in the sentence “They had a heated argument, a real screaming match.” Because a quarrel consists less of thought than of emotion, a clash of egos that frequently degenerates into mindless babble, this definition of argument has little relevance to critical thinking. For our purposes, therefore, an argument is not a quarrel.

「argument」这个单词有几种含义，因此我们的首要任务是澄清每一种含义并说明它与另外几种的区别。一种常见的含义是“争吵”，比如如“他们有一次激烈的「argument」（争吵），那真是一次真正的尖叫比赛。”因为争吵的组成中思考少于情感，自我的冲突经常恶化为无意义的混乱，这种定义和理性思维几乎没有关系。因此，为了我们的目的（理性思维），「argument」不是争吵的意思。

> Another meaning of argument is “the exchange of opinions between two or more people,” as occurs in a formal debate. In this sense of the term, an argument is ideally a cooperative endeavor in which people with different viewpoints work together to achieve a deeper, more accurate, understanding of an issue. In such an endeavor egos are controlled and everyone, though wanting to be right, is willing to be proved wrong. Since everyone emerges from the process with greater insight, no one loses. Alas, egos are not easily suppressed. Besides, most of us have been conditioned to believe there must be a winner and a loser in every argument, just as in every athletic contest. Thus we often focus more on “scoring points” against our “opponent” than on growing in knowledge and wisdom, so even our best efforts tend to fall short of the ideal.

「argument」的另一种意思是指“两个或两个以上的人之间的意见交换”，就如在正式辩论中发生的那样。在这个意义上，「argument」是理想的合作尝试，其中不同观点的人共同努力，从而实现对一个问题更深、更精确的理解。在这种努力下，自我被控制，虽然每个人想要自己是对的，但也愿意被证明是错误的。由于每个人都从中获得了更多的洞察力，因此没有人输。唉，自我不容易被压制。另外，我们中的大多数人都习惯认为每次辩论中必须有胜利者和失败者，就像每场运动比赛一样。因此我们通常更关注于我们“对手”的得分，而不是自身知识和智慧的增长，所以即使是我们最好的努力也往往达不到理想。

> Although argument as “the exchange of opinions between two or more people” is relevant to critical thinking, another meaning of the term is even more relevant to the challenge of becoming a critical thinker. Argument, in this sense, means “the line of reasoning that supports ajudgment.” When we say, “John’s argument on the issue of capital punishment was more persuasive than Sally’s,” we are focusing on the quality of his individual contribution to the overall deliberation. Because our main concern in this chapter, as throughout this book, is the evaluation of individual arguments, your own as well as other people’s, this definition is the one we will focus on.

虽然 argument 作为“两个或两个以上的人之间的意见交换”意思时与理性思考相关，但这个单词的另一种意思与成为一名理性思考者的挑战更为相关。在这种意思中，「argument」 意味着“用于支持判断的推理路线”。当我们说“约翰对死刑的 「argument」（理由/论点） 比莎丽的更有说服力”时， 我们关注的是他为综合考虑所贡献的质量。因为我们在本章中的主要关注点，正如本书中所说的，是对个人「argument」（论点）的评估，包括你自己和他人的，而这个定义是我们将要关注的。

> It can be helpful to think of an argument as a kind of verbal equation without mathematical symbols. A numerical equation has the form 1+1=2 or 2-1=1. A verbal equation expresses similar relationships without using minus, plus, or equal signs. Here is an example:

把论证看作一种没有数学符号的语言方程，这是很有帮助的。一个数学方程的形式为 1 + 1 = 2 或者2 - 1 = 1。 一个语言方程表达了相似的关系，只是不使用减号、加号或者等号。下面是一个例子：

* > ​The law prohibits teachers from leading class prayers in public schools.

法律禁止教师在公立学校带领班级祷告。

* > Wynona leads students in prayer in her public school classroom.Therefore, Wynona is breaking the law.

  Wynona在她公立学校的教室里带领学生祷告。因此，Wynona 违反了法律。

> Like numerical equations, arguments may be complex as well as simple. Just as the sum in a numerical equation may be composed of many numbers \(342 + 186 + 232 + 111 = 871\), so the conclusion of an argument may proceed from many premises \(assertions\). And just as having an incorrect number in a column of figures will result in a wrong total, so having an incorrect assertion will lead to a wrong conclusion.\* In the class prayer argument, if we mistakenly think that the law permits teachers to lead students in prayer, our conclusion would be that Wynona is notbreaking the law, and that conclusion would be wrong.

就像数字方程一样，论证可能很简单，也可能很复杂。正如数字等式中的和可以由许个数组成一样（342 + 186 + 232 + 111 = 871），一个论点的结论可能来自许多的前提（断言）。 也正如一列数字中的错误数字会导致错误的总数一样，有一个错误的断言也会导致错误的结论。 在班级祷告的论证中，如果我们错误地认为法律允许老师带领学生祷告，我们的结论会是 Wynona 没有违反法律，而这个结论就会是错的。

> Numerical equations and arguments are not, however, entirely similar.One important difference is that an argument is often more complex and difficult to test. Does vitamin C prevent the common cold or lessen its severity? Does television violence cause real violence? Was John F.Kennedy killed by a single assassin? Was Israel justified in bombing Lebanon in 2006? In these and many other matters, the evidence is either not yet complete or is open to interpretation.

然而，数字方程和论证并不完全相似。一个重要的区别在于，辩论通常更复杂并且更难以测试。维生素 C 可以预防普通感冒或者减轻其严重程度吗？电视暴力会引起真正的暴力吗？肯尼迪总统是被一个暗杀者杀死的吗？2006 年以色列轰炸黎巴嫩有正当理由吗？在这些以及许多其他问题中，证据不是尚不完整就是还可作各种解释。
