All of this may suggest long, monotonous, time- and energy-consuming research little different from that required for a doctoral  dissertation. But that is a misconception. With a little practice, it is possible to use quickly and efficiently all the reference  sources mentioned. Even books needn’t be waded through page by page to find something useful. In mere seconds you can turn to the index \(usually at the end\) and look for the several headings your issue might be found under; then turn to  the  appropriate pages and read only those pages. If the book has no index, you can turn to the table of contents, read the   chapter titles, decide which chapters seem most relevant, and then scan them. 

所有这一切可能意味着长期的，单调的，费时费力的研究，与博士学位论文所需的研究几乎没有什么不同。但这是一个误解。通过一点练习，是可能快速并且有效率地使用所有提到过的参考资料。甚至书籍不必通过逐页费力阅读找到有用的东西。在几秒钟内你就能翻到索引（通常是在最后）并寻找几个你的问题可能会在下面被找到的标题；然后翻到合适的页码，只读那几页。如果书没有索引，你可以翻到目录，阅读章节标题，决定哪一章看起来最相关，然后对其进行浏览。

Efficiency can be more difficult to achieve in Internet searches because distractions often are more frequent and tempting.  Make a special effort to discipline your Internet searches, focusing your attention on relevant material only and resisting the temptation to wander.

效率可能在互联网搜索中更难以实现，因为使人分心的事往往更频繁，更诱人。作特别的努力使你的互联网搜索有条理，只集中注意力到相关材料，并抵制走神的诱惑。
