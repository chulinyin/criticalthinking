Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as old as time, but manipulation did not become a  science until the early twentieth century, when Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology, published his research on  conditioned \(learned\) reflexes. Pavlov found that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to drool at the sound of the bell even when no food was presented. An American psychologist, John Watson, was impressed with Pavlov’s  findings and applied them to human behavior. In Watson’s most famous experiment, he let a baby touch a laboratory rat. At  first, the baby was unafraid. But then Watson hit a hammer against metal whenever the baby reached out to touch the rat, and  the baby became frightened and cried. In time, the baby cried not only at the sight of the rat but also at the sight of anything  furry, such as a stuffed animal.\* Watson’s work earned him the title “father of behaviorism.”



Less well known is Watson’s application of behaviorist principles to advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working  for advertising agencies and soon recognized that the most effective appeal to consumers

was not to the mind but to the emotions. He advised advertisers to “tell \[the consumer\] something that will tie him up with fear,  something that will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response, or strike at a deep psychological or  habit need.” His attitude toward the consumer is perhaps best indicated by a statement he made in a presentation to  department store executives: “The consumer is to the manufacturer, the department stores and the advertising agencies, what  the green frog is to the physiologist.”16



Watson introduced these strategies in the 1920s and 1930s, the age of newspapers and radio. Since the advent of television,  these advertising strategies have grown more sophisticated and effective, so much so that many individuals and groups with  political and social agendas have adopted them. The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one being people’s  conviction that they are impervious to manipulation. This belief is mistaken, as many researchers have demonstrated. For  example, Solomon Asch showed that people’s reactions can be altered simply by changing the order of words in a series. He  asked study participants to evaluate a person by a series of adjectives. When he put positive adjectives first—”intelligent,  industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious”— the participants gave a positive evaluation. When he reversed the order, with “envious” coming first and “intelligent” last, they gave a negative evaluation.17

Similarly, research has shown that human memory can be manipulated. The way a question is asked can change the details in  a person’s memory and even make a person remember something that never happened!18

Of course, advertisers and people with political or social agendas are not content to stimulate emotions and\/or plant ideas in  our minds. They also seek to reinforce those impressions by repeating them again and again. The more people hear a slogan  or talking point, the more familiar it becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed through careful  thought. Sadly, “the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at  all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a  button and ‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had  to think.”19 Many of the beliefs we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in our minds in just this  way.

Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that “a climate of opinion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing that those  who live within it and know no other take it for granted.”20 The rise of mass culture and the sophisticated use of manipulation  have made this insight more relevant today than ever.
