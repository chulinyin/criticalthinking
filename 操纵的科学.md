> Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as old as time, but manipulation did not become a  science until the early twentieth century, when Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology, published his research on  conditioned \(learned\) reflexes. Pavlov found that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to drool at the sound of the bell even when no food was presented. An American psychologist, John Watson, was impressed with Pavlov’s  findings and applied them to human behavior. In Watson’s most famous experiment, he let a baby touch a laboratory rat. At  first, the baby was unafraid. But then Watson hit a hammer against metal whenever the baby reached out to touch the rat, and  the baby became frightened and cried. In time, the baby cried not only at the sight of the rat but also at the sight of anything  furry, such as a stuffed animal.\* Watson’s work earned him the title “father of behaviorism.”

* \*Modern ethical norms would not allow a child to be used in such an experiment.

试图影响他人的想法和行为无疑是古老的，但是操纵直到20世纪初，俄罗斯的心理学教授 Ivan Pavlov 发表了他对条件（学习）反射研究时， 才成为一门科学。 Pavlov 发现，当他通过摇铃喂狗时， 即使没有食物 ，他也可以让狗在铃声下流口水。美国的心理学家 John Watson 对 Pavlov 的发现印象深刻，并将其应用到人类行为。在 Watson 最著名的实验中，他让一个婴儿触摸一只实验室老鼠。起初小孩并不害怕。但是接着每当婴儿伸手触碰老鼠时，Watson 就用一个锤子敲击金属，婴儿被吓哭了。随着时间的推移，婴儿不仅在看到老鼠的时候会哭，而且看到任何毛茸茸的东西都会哭，如一个填充动物。 Watson 工作为他赢得了“行为学之父”的称号。

* 现代道德标准将不会允许一个孩子被用在这样一次实验中。


> Less well known is Watson’s application of behaviorist principles to advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working  for advertising agencies and soon recognized that the most effective appeal to consumers was not to the mind but to the emotions. He advised advertisers to “tell \[the consumer\] something that will tie him up with fear,  something that will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response, or strike at a deep psychological or  habit need.” His attitude toward the consumer is perhaps best indicated by a statement he made in a presentation to  department store executives: “The consumer is to the manufacturer, the department stores and the advertising agencies, what  the green frog is to the physiologist.”16

少为人知的是 Watson 的行为原则对广告的应用。他花了职业生涯的后半部分为广告公司工作，并很快认识到，**对消费者最有效的吸引力不在于心理，而在于情绪**。他建议广告商们“告诉消费者一些可以让他恐惧的东西，这将挑起一种温和的愤怒，将唤起一个深情的或者爱的回应，或者将击中一个深度的心理或习惯需要。”他对消费者的态度或许最好由他在对百货公司高管的一次演讲中的一句话表示：“”**消费者对于制造商、百货公司和广告代理商，就像绿青蛙之于生理学家。**“

> Watson introduced these strategies in the 1920s and 1930s, the age of newspapers and radio. Since the advent of television,  these advertising strategies have grown more sophisticated and effective, so much so that many individuals and groups with  political and social agendas have adopted them. The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one being people’s  conviction that they are impervious to manipulation. This belief is mistaken, as many researchers have demonstrated. For  example, Solomon Asch showed that people’s reactions can be altered simply by changing the order of words in a series. He  asked study participants to evaluate a person by a series of adjectives. When he put positive adjectives first—”intelligent,  industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious”— the participants gave a positive evaluation. When he reversed the order, with “envious” coming first and “intelligent” last, they gave a negative evaluation.17

 Watson 在20世纪20年代和30年代，报纸和广播的年代，介绍了这些策略。自从电视机的出现以来，这些广告策略已经变得更加复杂和有效，使得许多有政治和社会议题的个人和团体已经采用了他们。这些策略工作的原因有很多：主要的一个原因是**人们坚信他们是不受操纵的。正如许多研究者已经证明，这种信念是错误的。**例如， Solomon Asch 展示，通过改变一系列单词的顺序，人们的反应可以被简单地改变。他让研究参与者通过一系列的形容词评价一个人。当他将积极的形容词放在第一个——“聪明、勤奋、冲动、挑剔、固执、嫉妒”——参与者给了一个积极的评价。当他反转顺序，“妒忌”来到第一，“智慧”最后，他们给了一个消极的评价。

Similarly, research has shown that human memory can be manipulated. The way a question is asked can change the details in  a person’s memory and even make a person remember something that never happened!18

Of course, advertisers and people with political or social agendas are not content to stimulate emotions and\/or plant ideas in  our minds. They also seek to reinforce those impressions by repeating them again and again. The more people hear a slogan  or talking point, the more familiar it becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed through careful  thought. Sadly, “the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at  all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a  button and ‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had  to think.”19 Many of the beliefs we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in our minds in just this  way.

Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that “a climate of opinion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing that those  who live within it and know no other take it for granted.”20 The rise of mass culture and the sophisticated use of manipulation  have made this insight more relevant today than ever.
