> Some of the most difficult challenges in discovering truth occur in determining cause-and-effect relationships. Unfortunately, mistakes are common in such matters. One mistake is to see cause-and-effect relationships where there are none. Another is to see only the simple and obvious cause-and-effect relationships and miss the complex or subtle ones. A third is to believe that causation is relevant only to material forces and is unrelated to human affairs. To avoid such confusion, four facts must be understood:

在发现真理过程中的一些最困难的挑战，出现在确定因果关系中。不幸的是，错误在这种问题上是常见的。一个错误是看到不存在的因果关系。另一个是只看到简单明了的因果关系，错过了复杂或者微妙的关系。第三个是相信因果关系仅与物质力量有关而与人类事务无关。为了避免这些混淆，必须知道四个事实。

> \1. One event can precede another without causing it. Some people believe that when one event precedes another, it must be the cause of the other. Most superstition is rooted in this notion. For example, breaking a mirror, crossing paths with a black cat, or walking under a ladder is believed to cause misfortune. You don’t have to be superstitious to make this mistake. You may believe that your professor gave an unannounced quiz today because students were inattentive the day before yesterday, whereas he may have planned it at the beginning of the semester. Or you may believe the stock market fell because a new president took office,when other factors might have prompted the decline.

一、 **一件事可以先于另一件事（发生）而不导致它（的发生）。**有些人认为当一件事先于另一件事时，它一定是另一件事的原因。大多数迷信根植于于这个概念。例如，打碎一面镜子，遇见黑猫，或者在梯子下走路被认为会造成不幸。你不必迷信于犯这个错误。你可能认为你的教授今天突然测验是因为前天学生没有注意，然而他可能在学期开始时就已经计划好了。或者当其他因素可能导致股市的下跌时，你可能认为是因为新总统上任。

> The problem with believing that preceding events necessarily cause subsequent events is that such thinking overlooks the possibility of coincidence. This possibility is the basis of the principle that “correlation does not prove causation.” In order to establish a cause-and-effect relationship,it is necessary to rule out coincidence, or at least to make a persuasive case against it.

相信先前发生的事件必定导致后续事件的问题是，这种思维忽略了巧合的可能性。这种可能性是“相关性不证明因果关系”的原则的基础。为了建立一个因果关系，必须排除巧合，或者至少对其作出有说服力的案例。

> \2. Not all causation involves force or necessity. The term causation is commonly associated with a physical action affecting a material reality,such as, a lightning bolt striking a house and the house catching fire and burning. Or a flowerpot being accidentally dropped out a window andthen falling to the ground and breaking. Or a car speeding, failing to negotiate a curve, careening off the highway, and crashing into a tree. In such cases a scientific principle or law applies \(combustion, gravity, inertia\), and the effect is inevitable or at least highly predictable.

二、**不是所有的因果关系都涉及力量或者必然性。**因果关系通常与影响物质现实的物理动作相关联，如，一个闪电击中了一个房子，房子着火了。或者一个花盆意外掉落窗外，掉到地上碎了。或者一辆汽车加速，未能通过一个弯道，驶在高速公路，撞到了一颗树。在这种情况下一个科学原理或者法律适用（燃烧、重力、惯性），结果是难以避免的或者至少非常可预料的。

> That type of causation is valid, but it would be a mistake to think of it  as the only type. Causation also occurs in the nonmaterial realities we call human affairs—more specifically, in the processes of emotion and thought. That type of causation has little, if anything, to do with scientific principles or laws, is almost never inevitable, and is often difficult to pre-dict. If we are to avoid oversimplification, we need to define causation in a way that covers both the scientific realm and the realm of human affairs. Here is a footnote for this: As its first definition of cause, the Oxford English Dictionary gives “that which produces an effect; that which gives rise to any action, phenomenon, or condition.” The distinction between“produces” and “gives rise to” is what we are referring to here. We will therefore define causation as the phenomenon of one thing influencing the occurrence of another. The influence may be major or minor, direct or indirect, proximate or remote in time or space. It may also be irresistible, as in the examples of combustion, gravity, and inertia mentioned previously; or resistible, as in following parental teaching or the example of one’s peers. In the latter case, and in other matters involving ideas, the influence \(cause\) does not force the effect to occur but instead invites, encourages, or inspires it. Consider these examples:

**这种类型的因果关系是合理的，但是认为它是唯一的类型是错误的。因果关系还出现在我们称之为人类事务的非物质现实中**——更具体地说，**在处理情感和思维的过程中**。**这种类型的因果关系和科学原理或法律没有什么关系，几乎绝不是必然发生的，并且通常难以预料。**如果我们要避免过度简化，我们需要以一种同时覆盖科学领域和人类事务领域的方式来定义因果关系。这里是对这个的补充说明：作为原因的第一个定义，英国牛津字典给出“产生一种结果；引起任何行为、现象、或者状况。“ “产生”和“引起”的差别是我们在这里提到的。我们因此**把因果关系定义为一件事影响另一件事发生的现象。影响可以是主要或次要的，直接或间接的，在时间或者空间中近或远的。它还可以是不可抗拒的，**正如之前提到的燃烧、重力和惯性的例子；**或者可抵抗的**，正如下面父母的教育或者同伴的例子。在后一种情况中，以及在涉及想法的其他事项中，影响（原因）没有强迫结果发生而是邀请、鼓励或者激发。考虑这些例子：

* > The idea that intelligence is genetically determined led early twentieth-century educators to conclude that thinking cannot be taught, and thus to emphasize rote learning and expand vocational curriculums.
  >
  > 智力是通过遗传决定的观念导致二十世纪早期的教育家们认为思维不能被教授，并因此强调死记硬背和发展职业课程。
  >
  > The idea that people are naturally good, and therefore not personally responsible for their bad deeds, has shifted blame to parents, teachers, andsociety, and caused judges to treat criminals more leniently.
  >
  > 人天生是好的，因此无需亲自为他们的恶行负责的观念，把责任推卸给父母、老师和社会，并使法官更仁慈地对待罪犯。
  >
  > The idea that one race or ethnic group is superior to another has led to military campaigns against neighboring countries, discriminatory laws, slavery,and genocide.
  >
  > 一个种族或者民族优于另一个种族的观念导致对邻近国家的军事战役、歧视性法律、奴隶制和种族灭绝。
  >
  > The idea that “no one over thirty can be trusted,” which was popular in theUnited States during the 1960s and 1970s, led many young people to scorn both the advice of their parents and teachers and the accumulated wisdom of the past.
  >
  > 20世纪60年代到20世纪70年代期间在美国流行的“超过三十岁的人不可信”的观念，导致许多年轻人鄙视他们父母、老师的建议和过去积累的智慧。
  >
  > The idea that feelings are a reliable guide to behavior has led many people to set aside restraint and follow their impulses. This change has arguably led to an increase in incivility, road rage, and spouse abuse, among other social problems.
  >
  > 感觉是行为的可靠指南的观念，导致许多人放弃克制并跟随他们的冲动。这个改变可能导致粗鲁、路怒症和家庭暴力在其他社会问题中的上升。
  >
  > The idea that self-esteem is prerequisite to success changed the traditional idea of self-improvement, inspired hundreds of books focused on self-acceptance, and led educators to more indulgent views of homework, grading, and discipline.
  >
  > 自尊是成功的前提的观念改变了自我提升的传统观念，激发了成百上千本着重于自我接受的书，并导致教育家对家庭作业、评分等级和纪律有更加宽容的看法。

> In each of these examples, one idea influenced the occurrence of an action or belief and, in that sense, caused it. Columnist George Will no doubt had this view of causation in mind when he encountered the claim that “noone has ever dropped dead from viewing ‘Natural Born Killers,’ or listening to gangster rap records.” Will responded, “No one ever dropped dead reading ‘Der Sturmer,’ the Nazi anti-Semitic newspaper, but the culture it served caused six million Jews to drop dead.”11

上面每个例子中，一个观念影响了一种行为或者信念的出现，并在这个意义上导致它。专栏作家 George Will 无疑有这种因果观在脑中，当他遇到声称“没有人曾因观看‘天生杀人狂’或者听黑帮说唱唱片而死”时，他回应，“没有人因读'前锋'（纳粹反犹太人的报纸）而死，但是它服务的文化造成了6百万犹太人的死亡。”

> \3. There is a wild card in human affairs—free will. So far we have noted that causation occurs through force or necessity in material events,but through influence in nonmaterial events—that is, in human affairs.Also, that in human affairs, effects are to some extent predictable but much less so than in material events. Now we need to consider why they are less predictable. The answer is because people possess free will—that is,the capacity to respond in ways that oppose even the strongest influences. Free will is itself a causative factor, and one that can trump all others. This explains why some people who grow up in the worst ofcircumstances—for example, in dysfunctional, abusive families or in crime-ridden neighborhoods in which the main sources of income are drug dealing and prostitution—resist all the negative influences and become decent, hardworking, and law-abiding. \(It can also explain why some people who are more fortunate economically and socially fall short of those ideals.\)

三、**在人类的事务中有一张万能牌——自由意志。**到目前为止，我们已经注意到因果关系在物质事件中通过力或必然性发生，但是**在非物质事件（即在人类事务）中通过影响发生**。同样，在人类事务中，结果在某种程度上是可预料的，但是比在物质事件中少得多。现在我们需要考虑为什么它们是更不可预料的。答案是，因为人拥有自由意志——也就是说，以反对（影响）甚至是最强大影响的方式回应的能力。自由意志本身是一个因素，可以打败所有其他因素。这解释了为什么一些在最糟糕的环境中长大的人——例如，在单亲、虐待家庭或者在犯罪猖獗，主要收入来源是毒品交易和卖淫的街区——抵抗所有负面影响并成为体面、勤奋、守法。（这还解释了为什么一些在经济和社会上更幸运的人缺乏这些品质。）

> It has been rightly said that people can seldom choose the circum-stances life places them in, but they can always choose their responses to those circumstances because they possess free will. In any investigation of causes and effects in human affairs, the factor of free will must be considered. However, possessing free will is no guarantee that we will apply it.In fact, one factor makes such application difficult. That factor is habit.

俗话说的好，人几乎不能选择他们生活所在的环境，但是他们总是可以选择他们自己对这些环境的反应，因为他们拥有自由意志。在任何对人类事务的因果的研究中，自由意志的因素必须被考虑。然而，**拥有自由意志并不能保证我们能应用它**。事实上，**一个因素使这种应用变得困难。这个因素是习惯。**

> Habit inclines smokers to continue smoking, liars to continue lying,selfish people to go on being selfish, and countless people to unthinkingly embrace the latest fashion. When leading designers say “hemlines should be raised,” hordes of women comply. When oversized beltless denim jeans are in vogue, hordes of young men waddle down the street,the tops of their pants at the middle of their hips and the crotches of their pants touching their knees. When iconic athletes shave their heads,legions of fans shave theirs. Resisting the force of habit is always possible but never easy.

习惯使吸烟者倾向于继续吸烟，说谎者继续说谎，自私的人继续自私，无数人不经思考地接受最新的时尚。当最领先的设计师说“裙摆应该被升起来，”一大群女人遵守了。当超大的无带牛仔裤成为时尚，一大群年轻人蹒跚在街上，他们裤子的顶部在他们臀部的中间，他们裤子的胯部接触到了他们的膝盖。当形象的运动员剃光头，大批的粉丝也剃了光头。抵抗习惯的力量总是可能的但是绝不容易。

> The most difficult habits to break are those that accrue incrementally over time. Consider the acceptance of increasing violence and sex on TV and in films. In the 1950s, not much violence and sex were shown on screen, and what was shown was tame. Then viewers were given glimpses of blood and gore and brief peeks at naked flesh. Year by year, the number of such scenes increased and the camera drew in a little closer and lingered a little longer over them. Over time, one thematic taboo after another was broken. Eventually violence and sexuality were joined, and themes of rape,child molestation, and even cannibalism were introduced. More recently, the industry crafted a new vehicle for assaulting the senses—the forensics program, which depicts rape-murders as they happen, then presents every gory detail of the autopsies in extreme close-up, accompanied by frequent,graphic flashbacks to refresh in viewers’ minds the shocking details of the crimes.

**最难以打破的习惯是那些日积月累的习惯。**考虑对在电视上和电影中越来越多的暴力和性的接受。在20世纪50年代，没有多少暴力和性出现在屏幕上，被展示的是枯燥乏味的。接着观众被给予瞥见血腥和对裸体的短暂窥探。年复一年，这种场景的数量不断增加，在它们上的镜头拉得更近一点，逗留得更长一点。随着时间的推移，一个接着一个的主题禁忌被打破。最终暴力和性被加入，强奸、猥亵儿童，甚至食人的主题都被介绍。最近，该行业作为刺激感觉制作了一个新的手段——法医程序，描绘强奸谋杀的发生，接着用特写镜头展现验尸中的每一个血腥细节，伴随着频繁的生动倒叙以便更新观众脑中的令人震惊的犯罪细节。

> At first the violent and sexual content provoked protests. In time, however, as sensational images became familiar, people formed the habit of accepting them, and the protests diminished. \(In time the habit grew so strong that anyone who objected to graphic sex and violence was considered odd.\) What happened in this case was not that people lost their free-dom or ability to protest, but instead that habit took away their inclination to protest.

起初，暴力和性内容引起了抗议。然而，一段时间以后，随着耸人听闻的图像变得熟悉，人们养成了接受它们的习惯，抗议也减少了。（一段时间以后，习惯变得如此强大以至于任何反对描写性和暴力的人被认为是奇怪的。）在这个事例中发生的并不是人们丧失了他们抗议的自由或者能力，而是习惯剥夺了他们抗议的意愿。

> \4. Causation is often complex. When a small pebble is dropped into a serene pool of water, it causes ripples in every direction, and those ripples can affect even distant waters. NASA researchers have found a similar process at work in the atmosphere: tiny particles in the air called aerosols can have a rippling effect on the climate thousands of miles away from their source region.

四、**因果关系往往很复杂。**当一块小石头被扔进一个宁静的水池，它在每个方向都造成了涟漪，这些涟漪甚至可以影响远处的水。 NASN 研究者在大气中发现了类似的过程：空气中被称为气溶胶的小颗粒可以对距离其发源地数千英里远的气候产生涟漪效应。

> Effects in human affairs can also be complex. In an effort to cut costs, the owner of a chemical plant may dispose of chemicals in a nearby stream that flows into a river. This action may result in effects he did not intend, including the pollution of the river, the killing of fish, and even the contracting of cancer by people living far from his plant. Those effects will be no less real because he did not intend them.

人类事务中的效应也可以很复杂。为了削减成本，化工厂的拥有者可能将化学制品处理在一个会流入河的附近溪流中。这个行为可能导致他不想要的结果，包括河流污染、对鱼类的杀戮、甚至使住在远离他工厂的人感染癌症。这些结果将不亚于真实的，因为他不想要它们。

> A woman in the early stages of influenza, unaware that she is ill, may sneeze while on a crowded airplane and infect dozens of her fellow passengers. As a result, they may lose time at work; some may have to be hospitalized; those with compromised immune systems could conceivably die. Given her lack of knowledge of her condition, no reasonable person would consider her culpable \(morally responsible\) for the effects of her sneeze, but there would still be no doubt that she caused them.

一个女人在流感的早期阶段没有意识到她生病了，可能在拥挤的飞机上打喷嚏，并感染十几名乘客。结果，他们可能会失去工作时间；有些可能不得不住院；那些免疫系统受损的人可能死亡。鉴于她不了解她情况，没有理性的人会认为她应为她喷嚏的结果负责（道德责任），但是依然无疑是她造成了这些。

> A car is driving on the interstate at night. In rapid succession, a deer jumps out and, the driver slams on his brakes but still hits and kills thedeer, the car traveling closely behind slams into his car, and five other cars do likewise, each crashing into the car in front. As a result of this chain reaction, the drivers and passengers suffer a variety of injuries—minor in the case of those wearing seat belts, major in others. The task of identifying the causative factors requires careful attention to the details.The initial cause was the deer’s crossing the road at an unfortunate time,but that is not the only cause. The first driver caused the deer’s demise. Each of the other drivers caused the damage to the front end of his or her car and back end of the car in front.\* And the passengers who did not fas-ten their seat belts caused their injuries to be more severe than those of other drivers and passengers.

一辆汽车晚上行驶在洲际公路上。突然，一只鹿跳了出来，司机猛踩刹车，但是依然撞死了鹿，紧跟在后面的车猛烈地撞上了他的车，另外五辆车也是这样，每辆都撞到了前面的车。作为这次连锁反应的结果，司机和乘客受了各种伤——那些系了安全带的人受伤较小，其他人则比较严重。确定原因需要仔细注意细节。最初的原因是鹿在一个不幸运的时间过马路，但这不是唯一的原因。第一位司机造成了鹿的死亡。其他每位司机都对他/她的汽车前端的以及前面的汽车后端造成了损坏。没有系安全带的乘客使他们受的伤比其他乘客和驾驶员更严重。

> These examples contain a valuable lesson about the need for care in investigating causes and effects. But this lesson will be even clearer if we examine a case in the way investigation usually proceeds—backward in time from the latest effect to the earliest causative factor; that is, to the“root” cause.

这些例子包含了一个有价值的教训，**需要小心调查原因和影响。**但是如果我们以调查研究通常进行的方式——**回顾从最近的影响到最早的原因（即根原因），审查一个案件，**这个教训将更加清晰。

> For example, it has been clear for some time that the number of people of Middle Eastern origin living in Europe has increased so dramatically that before long, according to some observers, Europe might well be called “Eurabia.” What caused this change? Analysts found that for decades European companies, with their governments’ blessing, have been inviting foreigners to work in their countries, and these workers brought their families, formed their own enclaves, built their own mosques and churches, and “planted” their own ethnic cultures. The next question is what caused the governments to approve this influx of workers? The answer is that the native population of European countries had declined to a point near or below “replacement level” and there were too few native-born workers to fill the available jobs and thus fund older people’s pensions and health care services.

例如，一段时间以来，居住在欧洲的中东人口数量增长得如此惊人以至于不久之后，据某些观察者所说，欧洲可能被称为欧拉伯更好。什么造成了这个变化？分析员发现，几十年来，欧洲公司在政府的支持下一直在邀请外国人去他们的国家工作，这些工作者带去了他们的家属，形成了自己的飞地，建造了自己的清真寺和教堂，并种植了自己的名族文化。下一个问题是什么促使政府批准这种工作者的大量涌入？答案是欧洲国家的本地人口已经下降到接近或者低于“更替水平”的点了，而且本地出生的工人太少以至于不能填补现有的工作，从而为老年人的养老金和健康保健服务提供资金。

> What caused the population decline? The availability of effective birthcontrol techniques in the 1960s and 1970s and the choice of more and more families to employ those techniques. What caused so many families to limit the number of their children? One factor was the century-long population movement from rural areas to cities, where children are an economic burden rather than an asset. Others were the growing emphasis on self-fulfillment and the corresponding tendency to regard child rearing as self-stifling.

什么造成了人口下降？在20世纪60年代和70年代可获得的有效的生育控制技术以及越来越多的家庭选择使用这些技术。什么造成了如此多的家庭限制孩子的数量？一个因素是从农村地区到城市的世纪人迁移，在那里孩子是经济负担而不是资产。其他因素是越来越强调自我实现，以及相应地倾向于将孩子抚养视为自我扼杀。

> As even this brief analysis of causes and effects suggests, facile responses to complex issues—in this case, “Middle Easterners are trying to take over Europe” or “The Crusades are here again, in reverse”—are not only unhelpful but unfair. The following cautions will help you avoid oversimplification in your analyses:

即使是这个简短的因果分析都表明，对复杂问题的轻率反应——在这个案例中，“中东人正试图接管欧洲”或者“相反，十字军又来了”——不仅无益而且不公平。下面的因果关系将帮助你避免在分析中过于简单化：

* > **Remember that events seldom, if ever, “just happen.” **They occur as the result of specific influences, and these influences may be major or minor, director indirect, proximate or remote in time or space; also irresistible \(forced or necessary\) or resistible \(invited, encouraged, or inspired\).

  **记住，事件几乎不会“就这样发生了”。**它们作为特定影响的结果发生，并且这些影响可能是主要或次要的，直接或间接的，在时间或者空间中近或远的；它还可以是不可抵抗（不得已或必然的）或者可抵抗的（邀请、鼓励或者激发的）。

* > **Remember that free will is a powerful causative factor in human affairs, **and it is often intertwined with other causes. In the case of the changes in European society, the movement of people from farm to city and the use of birth control were individual choices, but the greater availability of jobs in the cities \(an economic reality\) and birth control technology \(a scientific development\) were not.

  **记住在人类事务中，自由意志是一个强大的因素，**并且它经常与其他原因纠缠在一起。在欧洲社会变化的情况下，人们从农场到城市的迁移和使用节育是个体的选择，而城市中更多的就业机会（经济现实）和节育技术（科学发展）不是。

* > **Be aware that in a chain of events, an effect often becomes a cause.** For exam-ple, the decline in population in Europe caused the importation of foreign workers, which in turn caused a change in the ratio of native-born to foreign citizens, which may in time alter the continent’s dominant values and attitudes.

  **要知道到在一连串的事件中，一个结果往往成为一个原因。**例如，欧洲人口下降导致了外国工人的引进，从而导致了本国出生人口与外国公民的比例变化，这可能及时改变欧洲大陆的主导价值观和态度。

* > **Be aware that, in dealing with human affairs, outcomes can be unpredictable.** Therefore, in determining causes, you may have to settle for probability rather than certainty \(as you would in matters that lend themselves to scientific measurement\). In other words, you might conclude that something is more likely than not or, when the probability is very high, substantially more likely to be the cause. Either of these conclusions has significantly more force than mere possibility, but it falls short of certainty. The difference is roughly analogous to the difference in legal standards of judgment: in civil cases, the standard is “a preponderance of the evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence,” whereas in criminalcases it is the more demanding standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt.”

  **要知道，在处理人类事务时，结果可能是不可预测的。**因此，在确定原因时，你可能不得不接受概率而不是确定性（正如在适合科学测量的事情中）。换句话说，你可能推断一些事情更有可能，或者当可能性非常高的时候，大体上更可能是原因。这两种结论中的任何一种都比单纯的可能性有更多的力量，但是它不足以确定。区别大致类似于法律判决标准的不同：在民事案件中，标准是“证据方面的优势”或者“清晰和令人信服的证据”，然而在刑事案件中是更苛刻的标准“排除合理质疑”。

> In searching for truth, when you encounter possible cause-and-effect relationships, keep these cautions in mind.

在寻找真理过程中，当你遇到了可能的因果关系时，记住这些注意事项。
