> The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After reading the statement, use the library and\/or the Internet and find what knowledgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct a view of your own that combines insights from all views and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or anoral report, as your instructor specifies.

下面一段文章总结了一个重要的不同意见。在阅读该陈述之后，使用图书馆和互联网，寻找知识渊博的人关于这个问题说了什么。确保覆盖了整个范围的观点。然后评价每个观点的优缺点。如果你推断一个观点是完全正确的，而其他观点是错误的，解释你是如何得到这个结论的。更可能的情况是，你发现一个观点比其它观点更富有洞察力，但是它们都有一些正确的点，则结合所有观点的见解，构造一个你自己的观点，并解释为什么这个观点是所有观点中最合理的。按照你老师的指定，在一个书面或者口头报告中展示你的回答。

* > **What response should the United States make to the problem of illegal immigration?** As violence on the southern U.S. border increases and illegal entry continues, many Americans are becoming impatient with the federal government’s failure to solve the border problem. The state of Arizona has already taken action to apprehend illegals but has been criticized for interfering in matters under federal jurisdiction. Is Arizona’s approach the most reasonable one? If not, what approach would be?
