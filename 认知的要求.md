> Nancy was in a better position than Marie because she answered correctly. Yet she didn’t know for knowing involves more than having the right answer. It also involves the realization that you have it.

Nancy 比 Marie 在更好的位置，因为她答对了。然而她不知道，认知涉及的不只是拥有正确答案。它还涉及你对它的认知。

> The issue, of course, may not always be as simple as the spelling of a word. It may require understanding numerous details or complex principles or steps in a process. \(It may also involve a skill—knowing how to do something. But that is a slightly different use of the word than concerns us here.\)

当然，问题可能不总是如拼写单词那样简单。认知可能需要理解过程中的很多细节、复杂的原理或者步骤。（它可能还涉及一个技能——知道如何做某事。`但这个用法与我们这里所关心的略微不同。`）

> Knowing usually implies something else, too—the ability to express what is known and how we came to know it. This, however, is not always so.

认知也通常意味着其他东西——表达什么是已知的以及我们如何知道它的能力。然而，这并非总是如此。

> We may not be able to express our knowledge in words. The best we maybe able to say is “I just know, that’s all” or “I know because I know.” Yet these replies are feeble and hardly satisfy those who wish to verify ourknowledge or acquire it.

我们可能无法用言语表达我们的知识。我们也许能说的最好的是“我就是知道”或者“因为我知道，所以我知道。”然而这些答复是站不住脚的并且几乎不能让那些想要验证或者接受我们知识的人满意。
