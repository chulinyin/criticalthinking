> Most modern researchers use the word mind synonymously with brain, as if the physical organ that resides in the human skull were solely responsible for thinking. This practice conveniently presupposes that a problem that has challenged the greatest thinkers for millennia—the relationship between mind and physical matter—was somehow solved when no one was looking. The problem itself and the individuals who spent their lives wrestling with it deserve better.

大多数现代的研究者们使用单词头脑与大脑同义，好像居住在人类颅骨里的身体器官完全对思考负责。这种做法方便地预先假定已经挑战最伟大的思想者一千年的问题——精神和肉体间的关系——在没有人看着的时候就被以某种方式解决了。问题本身和耗费生命全力解决它的个体应该值得更好。

> Neuroscience has provided a number of valuable insights into the cognitive or thinking activities of the brain. It has documented that the left hemisphere of the brain deals mainly with detailed language processing and is associated with analysis and logical thinking, that the right hemisphere deals mainly with sensory images and is associated with intuition and creative thinking, and that the small bundle of nerves that lies between the hemispheres—the corpus callosum—integrates the various functions.

神经科学已经为大脑的认知或者思维活动提供了大量有价值的见解。它已经证明，左脑主要处理精细的语言进程，并与分析和逻辑思维有关，右脑主要处理感官影像，并与直觉和创造性思维有关，位于左右脑间的小神经束——胼胝体，使各种各样的功能成为一体。

> The research that produced these insights showed that the brain is necessary for thought, but it has not shown that the brain is sufficient for thought. In fact, many philosophers claim it can never show that. They argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity. Examine brain cells under the most powerful microscope and you will never see an idea or concept—for example, beauty, government, equality, or love—because ideas and concepts are not material entities and so have no physical dimension. Where, then, do these nonmaterial things reside? In the nonmaterial mind. 5

产生这些见解的研究说明大脑是思考所必须的，但是它并没有说明大脑对思考是足够的。事实上，许多哲学家声称它永远都不可能说明。他们认为精神和大脑是明显不同的。然而大脑是由物质组成的一个实体，因此受到衰变的影响，而精神是一个抽象的实体。在最强大的显微镜下检查脑细胞，你绝不会看到一个想法或者概念——例如，美、政府、平等或者爱——因为想法和概念不是物质实体，因此没有物理尺寸。那么，这些非物质的东西居住在哪里呢？在非物质的精神里。

> The late American philosopher William Barrett observed that “history is, fundamentally, the adventure of human consciousness” and “the fundamental history of humankind is the history of mind.” In his view,“one of the supreme ironies of modern history” is the fact that science,which owes its very existence to the human mind, has had the audacity to deny the reality of the mind. As he put it, “the offspring denies theparent.”6

已故的美国哲学家 William Barrett 指出“历史从根本上说，是人类意识的探险”和“人类的基本历史是思想史。”在他看来，“现代史的一个最大讽刺”是科学把它的存在归因于人类精神，科学已经大胆妄为地拒绝精神现实的事实。正如他所说的那样，“后代否认父母。”

> The argument over whether the mind is a reality is not the only issue about the mind that has been hotly debated over the centuries. One especially important issue is whether the mind is passive, a blank slate on which experience writes, as John Locke held, or active, a vehicle by which we take the initiative and exercise our free will, as G. W. Leibnitz argued.This book is based on the latter view.

关于精神是否是现实的争论不是几个世纪以来一直热烈争论的心灵的唯一问题。一个特别重要的问题是精神是否是被动的，是经验书写的一张白纸，正如 John Locke 认为的， 或者是主动的， 一个我们采取主动并锻炼我们自由意志的工具，正如 G. W. Leibnitz 认为的。本书是基于后一个观点的。
