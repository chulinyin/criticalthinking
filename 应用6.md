> \1. Many years ago an expert on thinking made this observation: “Probably the main characteristic of the trained thinker is that he does not jump to conclusions on insufficient evidence as the untrained man is inclined to do.”4 (Note: At that time, he and man were commonly used to denote both men and women.)Think of several recent occasions when you formed opinions with little or no evi-dence. In each case state the opinion and explain what kind of evidence would be necessary to support it adequately.

许多年以前，一位思考专家做出评论：“或许经过经过训练的思考者的主要特征是他/她不会在证据不足时得出结论，而未经过训练的人倾向于这样做。”想想最近几次你形成观点用却很少或者没有证据的时候。陈述每种情况中的观点，并解释为了充分证明观点，哪种类型的证据是必须的。

> \3. Some years ago,a well-known television actress was on a talk show discussing a number of topics, including an episode of her show in which two lesbians kissed on camera. The actress volunteered this opinion: “This is a time in our society when homophobia is really huge and crimes against gays are at an all-time high.” If the talk show host had been a critical thinker, what questions would he have asked at that point? What kind of evidence would be helpful in testing the reasonableness of her opinion?

几年前，一位著名的电视女演员在一个脱口秀节目中讨论了一系列话题，其中包括在她的一集演出中，两个女同性恋者在镜头前亲吻的一个小插曲。然后该女演员主动提出了这个观点：“在这个时期，我们社会对同性恋的恐惧真的很大，并且反同性恋的罪行正处于历史最高点。”如果脱口秀的主持人是一位理性思考者，他会对这个观点提出什么问题呢？什么类型的证据会有助于测试她观点的合理性？
