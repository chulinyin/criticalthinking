Inquiry is seeking answers to questions, investigating issues, and gathering information to help us draw conclusions. It enables  us to get beyond our first impressions, feelings, preconceived notions, and personal preferences. 



There are two basic kinds of inquiry: inquiry into facts and inquiry into opinions. Opinions, remember, can be informed or  uninformed. Except in cases where the purpose of our inquiry demands that both varieties of opinion be gathered, we should  be more interested in informed opinion.

Often we will need to inquire into both facts and opinions. How much inquiry into each is needed will, of course, vary from  situation to situation. If the specific issue were Which U.S. income group is most inequitably treated by the present federal tax  laws? we would have to examine the tax laws to determine what they specify \( fact\) and consult the tax experts for their  interpretations of the more complicated aspects of the laws \(informed opinion\). But to determine the degree of inequity, we  would have to know the amount of income necessary to provide living essentials \(food, shelter, and clothing\). So we would also have to examine cost-of-living statistics \( fact\) and consult economists about subtler factors affecting the various income groups \(informed opinion\).
