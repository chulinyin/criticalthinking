> Because the state of human knowledge is imperfect, not every question is answerable when it is asked. Some issues remain  unresolved for years, even centuries. Before we traveled into outer space, no one knew exactly what the effects of weightlessness on the human body would be. Many respected doctors argued that the rapid acceleration at blast-off would  increase an astronaut’s heartbeat to a fatal level. \(There was strong medical evidence to support this view.\) Others believed that weightlessness would cause vital organs to malfunction and atrophy. 1 Both dire predictions proved mistaken, but any  inquiry into the issue undertaken before the first successful launch would necessarily have been incomplete.

因为人类知识的状态是不完美的，所以不是每一个问题被问到的时候都是有答案的。有些问题好几年，甚至几个世纪，仍然没有解决。在我们前往进入外太空前，没有人确切地知道失重会对人类的身体有什么影响。许多受人尊敬的医生认为，发射的快速加速度会使宇航员的心跳增加到一个致命的水平。（有强有力的医学证据来支持这一观点。）其他人认为失重会导致重要器官的故障和萎缩。这两个可怕的预测被证明是错误的，但是在第一次成功发射之前对问题着手的任何调查一定是不完整的。

> Which mountain in the Sinai desert did Moses really climb? The Bible gives it a name \(actually two names\), but scholars differ  on where it is located. Strong claims are advanced for three different mountains in three countries. No conclusive answer has  been reached despite more than three thousand years of inquiry.2

在西奈沙漠的哪座山是摩西真正爬过的？圣经给它了一个名字（实际上是两个名字），但是学者对它位于哪里持不同意见。对三个国家的三个不同的山脉提出了强烈的要求。尽管有超过三千年的调查，但没有得出令人信服的答案

> Some questions are even more resistant to inquiry—for example, the question, Are there intelligent life-forms in our solar  system or other planetary systems? Scientists estimate that the universe is 156 billion light-years wide and still expanding. Our  sun is one of billions of stars, many of which could harbor intelligent life-forms, so it’s conceivable that any inquiry into this  question made in the next million years will be inconclusive. Perhaps the answer will never be known.

一些问题甚至更耐询问——例如：在我们太阳系或者其他行星系有智慧的生命形式吗？科学家预测宇宙有1560亿光年宽并且仍然在扩大。我们的太阳是几十亿恒星中的一个，其中许多恒星可以庇护智慧的生命形式，所以可以想象任何在未来的百万年里对这个问题的调查都将是不确定的。或许永远也不可能知道 答案 。

> However resistant to resolution a question may be, though, inquiry is still useful. Even if it yields no more than the untestable opinions of experts, those opinions are more valuable than the casual speculations of the uninformed. So we shouldn’t be intimidated by difficult issues. We should merely be realistic about how complete and final our answers are likely to be.

然而对解决问题可能是抵制的，即使，调查仍然是有用的。即使它产生了不比比专家更不可测的观点，这些观点比无知的随意猜测更有价值。所以我们不应该被困难的问题所威胁。我们应该仅仅面对现实——我们的答案可能是多么完整、多么毋庸置疑的。
