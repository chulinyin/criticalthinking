> Not only are you a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens, but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that  species and in a particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings,  beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. If you had lived in America in  colonial times, you likely would have had no objection to the practice of barring women from serving on a jury, entering into a  legal contract, owning property, or voting. If you had lived in the nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young  children being denied an education and being hired out by their parents to work sixteen hours a day, nor would you have given  any thought to the special needs of adolescence. \(The concept of adolescence was not invented until 1904.\)1

你不仅仅是一个特殊物种的成员，智人，你还存在于那个物种历史中的特殊时期，以及该星球上的特殊位置。那个时间和空间是由特定的环境，理解，信念，和习俗定义的，所有这些都限制了你的经验，影响了你的思维模式。如果你在殖民地时期住在美国，你可能不会反对禁止妇女担任陪审团、签订法律何荣、拥有财产或者投票权的做法。如果你住在19世纪，你就不会反对孩子们被拒绝接受教育，被他们的父母租用出去，每天工作16小时，你也不会考虑到青春期的特殊需要。（青春期的概念直到1904年才被发明。）

If you had been raised in the Middle East, you would stand much closer to people you converse with than you do in America. If  you had been raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your parents choose your spouse for you. If your  native language were Spanish and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused by some English  colloquialisms. James Henslin offers two amusing examples of such confusion: Chevrolet Novas initially sold very poorly in Mexico because no va in Spanish means “it doesn’t work”; and Perdue chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion \(or  worse\) because the company’s slogan—”It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”— became in Spanish “It takes an  aroused man to make a chicken affectionate.”2



People who grow up in Europe, Asia, or South America have very different ideas of punctuality. As Daniel Goleman explains,  “Five minutes is late but permissible for a business appointment in the U.S., but thirty minutes is normal in Arab countries. In  England five to fifteen minutes is the ‘correct’ lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian might come two hours late, an  Ethiopian still later, a Javanese not at all, having accepted only to prevent his host’s losing face.”3Adifferent ethnic origin would  also mean different tastes in food. Instead of craving a New York Strip steak and french fries, you might crave “raw monkey brains” or “camel’s milk cheese patties cured in dry camel’s dung” and washed down with “warm camel’s blood.”4 Sociologist  Ian Robertson summed up the range of global dietary differences succinctly: “Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French  eat snails but not locusts. The Zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork. The Hindus eat pork but not beef.  The Russians eat beef but not snakes. The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jalé of New Guinea find people delicious.”5 \[Note: The reference to Hindus is mistaken.\]



To sum up, living in a different age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of  your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words, they still would influence your  responses.
