> Not only are you a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens, but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that  species and in a particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings,  beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. If you had lived in America in  colonial times, you likely would have had no objection to the practice of barring women from serving on a jury, entering into a  legal contract, owning property, or voting. If you had lived in the nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young  children being denied an education and being hired out by their parents to work sixteen hours a day, nor would you have given  any thought to the special needs of adolescence. \(The concept of adolescence was not invented until 1904.\)1

你不仅仅是一个特殊物种的成员，智人，你还存在于那个物种历史中的特殊时期，以及该星球上的特殊位置。那个时间和空间是由特定的环境，理解，信念，和习俗定义的，所有这些都限制了你的经验，影响了你的思维模式。如果你在殖民地时期住在美国，你可能不会反对禁止妇女担任陪审团、签订法律何荣、拥有财产或者投票权的做法。如果你住在19世纪，你就不会反对孩子们被拒绝接受教育，被他们的父母租用出去，每天工作16小时，你也不会考虑到青春期的特殊需要。（青春期的概念直到1904年才被发明。）

> If you had been raised in the Middle East, you would stand much closer to people you converse with than you do in America. If  you had been raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your parents choose your spouse for you. If your  native language were Spanish and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused by some English  colloquialisms. James Henslin offers two amusing examples of such confusion: Chevrolet Novas initially sold very poorly in Mexico because no va in Spanish means “it doesn’t work”; and Perdue chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion \(or  worse\) because the company’s slogan—”It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”— became in Spanish “It takes an  aroused man to make a chicken affectionate.”2

如果你出生在中东，你会比你在美国更接近你的谈话对象。如果你出生在印度，你可能会非常放心地让你父母为你选择配偶。如果你的母语是西班牙语，你的英语知识适中，你可能将会为一些英语口语困惑。James Henslin为这样的疑惑提供了两个假设的例子：雪佛兰Novas一开始在墨西哥卖得很差，因为no va在西班牙语中意味着“它不工作”；Perdue鸡肉被认为有一定的嫌疑（甚至更糟）因为公司的标语——“It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”\(他对鸡肉生产的严格标准，使他制作最好（嫩）的鸡肉\)——在西班牙语中变成了"It takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate"\(激起一只鸡性欲，需要一个唤起性欲的男人？）。

> People who grow up in Europe, Asia, or South America have very different ideas of punctuality. As Daniel Goleman explains,  “Five minutes is late but permissible for a business appointment in the U.S., but thirty minutes is normal in Arab countries. In  England five to fifteen minutes is the ‘correct’ lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian might come two hours late, an  Ethiopian still later, a Japanese not at all, having accepted only to prevent his host’s losing face.”3 A different ethnic origin would  also mean different tastes in food. Instead of craving a New York Strip steak and french fries, you might crave “raw monkey brains” or “camel’s milk cheese patties cured in dry camel’s dung” and washed down with “warm camel’s blood.”4 Sociologist  Ian Robertson summed up the range of global dietary differences succinctly: “Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French  eat snails but not locusts. The Zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork. The Hindus eat pork but not beef.  The Russians eat beef but not snakes. The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jalé of New Guinea find people delicious.”5 \[Note: The reference to Hindus is mistaken.\]

在欧洲、亚洲、南美洲长大的人对于守时有非常不同的想法。正如Daniel Goleman解释，“迟到五分钟，但是在美国的一个商务约会是允许的，但是在阿拉伯国家三十分钟是正常的。在英国，被邀请吃晚饭的人，迟到五到十五分钟是正确的。一个意大利人可能晚到两个小时，一个埃萨俄比亚人更晚，一个日本人一点都不接受，只是为了防止他的东道主丢面子。”一个不同的种族起源也将意味着对食物的不同品味。你可能渴望“生猴脑”或者“骆驼奶酪饼固化干燥的骆驼粪”和用“温暖的骆驼血冲洗”，而不是渴望一个纽约地带的牛排和薯条。社会学家Ian Robertson简洁地总结了全球范围的饮食差异：“美国人吃牡蛎但不吃蜗牛。法国人吃蜗牛但不吃蝗虫。祖鲁人吃蝗虫但不吃鱼。犹太人吃鱼但不吃猪肉。印度人吃猪肉但不吃牛肉。俄罗斯人吃牛肉但不吃蛇。中国人吃蛇但不吃人。新几内亚的 Jalé发现人很好吃 ”（注意：印度人的参考是错误的）

> To sum up, living in a different age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of  your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words, they still would influence your  responses.

综上所述，生活在不同的时代或者文化将使你成为一个不同的人。即使你反抗你所在时代和地方的价值观，它们依然会代表你生活的背景——换句话说，他们仍会影响你的反应。
