> The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After reading the statement, use the library and\/or the Internet and find what knowledgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct a view of your own that combines insights from all views and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or anoral report, as your instructor specifies.

下面一段文章总结了一个重要的不同意见。在阅读该陈述之后，使用图书馆和互联网，寻找知识渊博的人关于这个问题说了什么。确保覆盖了整个范围的观点。然后评价每个观点的优缺点。如果你推断一个观点是完全正确的，而其他观点是错误的，解释你是如何得到这个结论的。更可能的情况是，你发现一个观点比其它观点更富有洞察力，但是它们都有一些正确的点，则结合所有观点的见解，构造一个你自己的观点，并解释为什么这个观点是所有观点中最合理的。按照你老师的指定，在一个书面或者口头报告中展示你的回答。

* > Should captured terrorists be tried in military or criminal courts? When the United States decided to use the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,to detain individuals captured on the battlefield in the Iraq war, many people protested the decision. Some argued that captured individuals should be considered criminals rather than prisoners of war and accorded the rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to all people accused of crimes. Others argued for classifying the individuals as prisoners of war and treating them as specified in the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Supporters of the government’s decision reject both arguments, contending that captured terrorists are neither criminals nor soldiers but “unlawful combatants,” adding that any other designation would impose burdens on the United States that would make it difficult to fight terrorism and thereby threaten national security.

  被俘虏的恐怖分子者应该在军事法庭还是刑事法庭受审？当美国决定使用古巴的关塔那摩湾军事基地，拘留在伊拉克战争中的俘虏时，许多人抗议这个决定。一些人主张俘虏应该被视为罪犯而不是战俘，并且给予所有被控犯罪的人以美国宪法的权利保障。其他人则主张将这些个体划分为战俘，并按照1949日内瓦公约中的规定对待他们。政府决定的支持者同时反对这两个观点，认为被捕获的恐怖分子既不是罪犯也不是士兵，而是“非法的参战者”，添加任何其他的名称将为美国增加负担，那将使打击恐怖主义变得困难，因此威胁国家的安全。
