> One reason why knowing is difficult is that some long unanswered questions continue to resist solution, questions like What causes cancer? What approach to education is best for children? and How can we prevent crime without compromising individual rights?

认知困难的一个原因是一些长期未被回答的问题依然无法得到解决，如：什么导致了癌症？对孩子最好的教育方法是什么？以及我们如何在不损害个人权利的情况下阻止犯罪？

> Another reason is that everyday situations arise for which there are no precedents. When the brain procedure known as frontal lobotomy was developed to calm raging violence in people, it raised the question of the morality of a cure that robbed the patient of human sensibilities. When the heart transplant and the artificial heart became realities, the issue of which patients should be given priority was created, as well as the question of how donors were to be obtained. When smoking was definitely determined to be a causative factor in numerous fatal diseases, we were forced to examine the wisdom of allowing cigarette commercials to mislead TV viewers and entice them into harming themselves. More recently, when smoking was shown to harm the nonsmoker as well as the smoker, a debate arose concerning the rights of smokers and nonsmokers in public places.

另一个原因是每天都会出现没有先例的情况。当被称为前额脑叶切除手术的大脑手术被开发以便稳定暴力的人时，它产生了治疗的道德问题——剥夺了病人的人类情感。当心脏移植和人造心脏称为现实，创造了哪个病人应该被优先治疗以及如何获得捐献者的问题。当吸烟被明确地确定为许多致命疾病的致病因素时，我们被迫审查允许香烟广告误导电视观众并引诱他们伤害自己是否明智。最近，当吸烟被证明会伤害不吸烟者和吸烟者时，产生了一个关于吸烟者和不吸烟者在公共场所的权力的讨论。

> Still another reason why knowing is difficult is that, as one generation succeeds another, knowledge is often forgotten or unwisely rejected. For example, the ancient Greeks knew that whales have lungs instead of gills and therefore are mammals. Later, however, the Romans regarded whales as fish, a false notion that persisted in Western minds until the seventeenth century. In that century one man suggested that whales are really mammals, another later established it as fact, and the West rediscovered an item of knowledge.11

另一个为什么认知困难的原因是当一代人接替了另一代人，知识经常被遗忘或者不明智地拒绝。例如，古希腊人知道鲸鱼有肺而不是鳃，因此为哺乳动物。然而之后，罗马人把鲸鱼当作鱼类，这个错误概念在西方人脑中一直持续。直到17世纪，一个人认为鲸鱼真的是哺乳动物，之后另一个人将之定为事实，西方人重新获得了一项知识。

> In our time the ideas of “sin” and “guilt” have come to be regarded as useless and even harmful holdovers from Victorian times. The “new morality” urged people to put aside such old-fashioned notions as obstacles to happiness and fulfillment. Then Karl Menninger, one of America’s leading psychiatrists, wrote a book called Whatever Became of Sin? in which he argues that the notions of “sin” and “guilt” are good and necessary in civilized society.12 He says, in other words, that our age rejected those concepts too quickly and quite unwisely.

在我们的时代中，继承自维多利亚女王时代的“sin\(罪恶\)”和“guilt\(内疚\)”的想法被认为是无用甚至有害的。“新的道德规范”迫使人们把这些过时的概念作为幸福和满足的阻碍放一边。接着美国最杰出的精神病专家之一卡尔·梅宁格（Karl Menninger）写了一本名为“Whatever Became of Sin”的书，在这本书中他认为在文明社会中“sin”和“guilt”的概念是优秀并且必需的。他说，换句话说，我们的时代过快拒绝这些概念，十分不明智。

> Knowledge is often thought of as dead matter stored on dusty shelves in dull libraries. Unfortunately, the hushed atmosphere of a library can suggest a funeral chapel or a cemetery. But the appearance is deceiving. The ideas on those shelves are very much alive—and often fighting furiously with one another. Consider the following cases.

知识通常被认为是存储在灰暗图书馆里灰尘覆盖的书架上的无机物质。不幸的是，图书馆寂静的氛围可能暗示一个葬礼教堂或者一个墓地。但外表是骗人的。这些书架上的观点非常活跃并且经常彼此激烈争斗。考虑以下情况。

> The idea that Columbus was the first person from Europe, Africa, or Asia to land on the shores of North or South America hangs on tenaciously. The opposing idea challenges this again and again. \(The evidence against the Columbus theory continues to mount: the discovery of ancient Japanese pottery in Ecuador, traces of visits by seafarers from Sidon in 541 B.C. as well as by the Greeks and Hebrews in A.D. 200 and by the Vikings in A.D. 874.13 The most recent evidence suggests that the Chinese may have discovered America by 2500 B.C.\)14

哥伦布是登陆到北美或南美海岸中，第一个来自欧洲、非洲或亚洲的人的想法一直坚持不懈。相反的想法一次又一次地挑战它。（反对哥伦布理论的证据继续增加：在厄瓜多尔发现古代日本陶瓷，在公元前541年被来自西顿水手、在公元200年被希腊人和希伯来人和在公元874年被维京人，拜访的痕迹。最近的证据表明，中国人可能已经在公元七前2500年发现了美洲。）

> The idea that a history of slavery and deprivation has caused African Americans to have less self-esteem than whites was well established. Then it was challenged by two University of Connecticut sociologists, Jerold Heiss and Susan Owens. Their studies indicate that the self-esteem of middle-class African Americans is almost identical to that of middle-class whites and that the self-esteem of lower-class African Americans is higher than that of lower-class whites.15

奴隶制和贫困的历史导致非洲裔美国人比白人拥有更少的自尊的想法是已确立的。接着它被两个康涅狄格州大学的社会学专家 Jerold Heiss 和 Susan Owens 挑战了。他们的研究表明中产阶级非洲裔美国人的自尊几乎与中产阶级白人相同，并且低产阶级非洲裔美国人的自尊比低产阶级白人更高。

> The notion that when the youngest child leaves home, middle-aged parents, especially mothers, become deeply depressed and feel that life is over for them has many believers. Yet at least one study attacks that notion. It shows that many, perhaps most, parents are not depressed at all; rather, they look forward to a simpler, less demanding, life.16

当最小的孩子离开家，中年父母特别是母亲，会变得非常沮丧并且感到生活对他们来说已经结束了的想法有许多信徒。然而至少有一个研究抨击了这个概念。它表明很多，也许是大多数的父母一点都不沮丧；相反，他们期待一个更简单，需求更少的生活。

> Similarly, until recently, most scientists accepted that senility is a result of the physical deterioration of the brain and is both progressive and irreversible. Then experimenters in an Alabama veterans’ hospital found that in many cases the symptoms of senility—confusion, disorientation, and withdrawal from reality—can be halted and even reversed by“a simple program of keeping the aged constantly in touch with the surrounding environment.”17

同样，直到最近，大多数科学家接受了衰老是大脑体力衰退的结果，是渐进且不可逆的。接着在一个亚拉巴马州的老兵医院发现，在许多情况下衰老的症状——困惑、迷失方向感、退出现实，可以被阻止甚至通过“一个保持老年人不断接触周围环境的小程序”逆转。

> Books and articles referring to athletes’ “second wind” abound. Yet Nyles Humphrey and Robert Ruhling of the University of Utah have presented evidence that there really is no second wind and that the sensation experienced by many athletes is merely psychological. 18

引用运动员的喘过气来的书籍和文章比比皆是。然而犹他州大学的 Nyles Humphrey 和 Robert Ruhling 已经拿出证据，证明没有喘过气来，以及许多运动员所经历的感觉仅仅是心理上的。
