> Whenever possible, we should consult our own experience and observation. Even if what has happened to us or what we have seen happen to others pertains only indirectly to the issue or touches on just one aspect of it, it should not be overlooked. Our observation of how people use stereotypes or face-saving maneuvers in everyday situations can help us evaluate a political candidate’s speech or a party’s platform. Our experience with conformity in ourselves and our friends can provide us with an insight into the effects of TV programming on the public. Being alert to the relevance of our experience to the issue we are investigating not only can give us valuable ideas but also can suggest important questions. Thus it can provide our inquiry with better direction.

只要有可能，我们就应该参考自己的经验和观察。即使在我们身上发生（或者我们看见在其他人身上发生）的事与问题仅仅是间接相关或者仅仅关系到问题的一个方面，那就不应该忽略它。我们对人们怎样在日常生活中使用墨守成规的观念和保全面子的措施的观察，可以帮助我们评价一场政治候选人的演讲或者一场派对的舞台。在我们和我们的朋友之间的一致性经验可以让我们深入了解电视节目对公众的影响。对我们的经验与我们正在调查的问题的相关性保持警惕，不仅可以给我们宝贵的意见，也可以提出重要的问题。因此这可以为我们的调查提供更好的方向。

> Of course, our own experience and observation will seldom be adequate by itself, especially on complex and controversial matters. We will need to consult other sources. What follows is a brief guide to what to look for and where to find it.

当然，仅靠我们的经验和观察几乎是不够的，尤其是在复杂并且有争议的问题上。我们将需去参考其他资源。下面是寻找什么资源，哪里去找的一个简要的指南。

### 问题的背景

> Think of several general headings under which the issue might be classified. For example, if the issue concerns criminal investigation, the headings might be “crime,” “criminology,” “police,” and one or more specific kinds of crime, such as “burglary.” Then look up those headings in the index volume of a good general encyclopedia, such as Encyclopedia Americana or Encyclopaedia Britannica. \(Americana has a separate index volume. Britannica is divided into two sets of books: the macropaedia set, which contains detailed articles on a limited number of subjects, and the micropaedia set, which contains brief articles and cross-references on a large number of subjects.\) The articles you will find there have been written by authorities in the various fields. At the end of each article is a list of books and other articles you can consult for a fuller or more specialized treatment of the issue.

**想几个可能会被归入到问题下面的一般性标题**。比如，如果问题涉及犯罪调查，标题可能是“犯罪”、“犯罪学”、“警察”，以及若干个特别种类的犯罪，如“入室抢劫”。**然后再在一本好的通用的百科全书的索引卷中查找这些标题**，如美国百科全书或大英百科全书（美洲有一个单独的索引卷。大英百科全书被分为两集：详编百科集包含了对有限数量的主题的详细文章，简明百科集包含了对大量主题的简要文章和交叉引用。）你将会在那里**找到已经被各个领域的权威人士写过的文章**。每篇文章的最后是书和其他文章的列表，你可以**从中查阅对这个问题更全面或者对更专业的处理**。

> In addition to the general encyclopedias, there are numerous specific encyclopedias of art, business, history, literature, philosophy, music, science, education, social science, and many other areas. Most of these contain not only historical background but also titles of other books and articles you might find helpful.

除了通用的百科全书，在艺术、商业、历史、文学、哲学、音乐、科学、教育、社会科学等诸多领域，也有许多**具体的百科全书**。这些大多数**不仅包含历史背景，还会包含你可能发现有用的其他书和文章的标题**。

### 事实和统计数字

> Almanacs, published yearly, are treasuries of information on myriad subjects. World Almanac is available from the 1868 edition. Information Please Almanac, The New York Times Encyclopedic Almanac, and Reader’s Digest Almanac are more recent publications. Because any almanac is arranged very compactly for efficient use, it is important to study the index before using it.

每年出版的年鉴，是各种各样主题的信息宝藏。世界年鉴从1868版就可得到了。请提供信息年鉴、纽约时报百科年鉴、以及读者文摘年鉴是最新的出版物。由于任何年鉴为了高效使用都安排得非常紧凑，所以在使用前去学习一下索引是非常重要的。

### 关于人的信息

> A number of biographical dictionaries and encyclopedias are available. Two of the most helpful ones are Current Biography: Who’s News and Why and Webster’s Biographical Dictionary.

许多传记字典和百科全书可供选择。两个最有用的的是当前的传记：“谁的新闻，为什么”和“韦伯斯特的传记字典”

### 关于英文的信息

> Many reference books are available, including the Oxford English Dictionary \(OED\), Webster’s New Dictionary of Synonyms, and Eric Partridge’s Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English.

### 在报纸、杂志和期刊上的文章

> The most basic index to articles is the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature. This guide lists articles from more than one hundred magazines by subject and author. As with an encyclopedia, you should begin by thinking of the various headings under which the issue might be classified. Then select the volumes for the appropriate years \(more current years are listed in unbound pamphlet form\) and look up those headings. The entries will list the title and author of the article and the name and issue of the magazine it appeared in.

对文章最基本的索引是“期刊文献的读者指南”。这个指南从一百多本杂志中列出了相关主题及作者的文章。如同一本百科全书，你应该以思考可能被归入到问题下的不同的标题开始。然后选择合适的年卷（最新的年卷是以未绑定的小册子的形式上市）查找这些标题。这些条目将列出文章的标题和作者，以及它出现在其中的杂志的名字和发行号。

甚至在中等规模的图书馆， 许多其他的索引是可用的。上面是一部分清单 （如需完整的列表，请参考尤金·希伊的参考书指南）。

> After you locate the article and read it, be sure to check the reader response in the letters-to-the-editor section of subsequent issues. Most newspapers and magazines have a letters section, and it will often provide reaction by informed readers  upporting or challenging the ideas in the article. In weekly magazines, responses usually appear two issues after the article; in  fortnightlies and monthlies, one issue later.

在你定位文章并阅读之后，一定要在后续问题的信到主编部分，检查读者的反响，这通常会通过读者对文中观点的支持或挑战提供。在周刊杂志，读者反响通常出现在文章的后两期；在半月刊和月刊，出现在后一期。

### 计算机数据库和摘要服务

> Modern information retrieval technology has made it easier than ever to conduct a data search. The technology continues to  evolve rapidly, but the cost of conversion from old systems to new can be considerable. Therefore, what is available in the  marketplace will not necessarily be available on a particular campus. Your campus librarian can tell you whether your campus  library has the research tools mentioned here and, if not, what comparable tools are available.

现代信息检索技术已经让进行一次数据搜索变得比以往更容易。技术仍在迅速发展，但是从旧系统转换到新系统的成本可能相当可观。因此，在市场上可用的不一定在一个特定的校园可用。你的校园图书管理员能够告诉你你的校园图书馆是否有这里提到的研究工具，如果没有，什么可比的工具是可用的。

> The principal change that is taking place in library technology is the conversion of the print index to an electronic index. The  kind of information traditionally found in the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature is now accessible in, for example, InfoTrak,  a system available in one of three forms: \(a\) as an electronic bibliographic guide without text, \(b\) as a bibliographic guide with  some text available on CDs, and \(c\) as a complete online service. Where the first and second forms of this system are used,  researchers still make extensive use of bound copies of periodicals and microfiche records. InfoTrak is generally available in  public libraries and in small academic libraries.

正发生在图书馆技术的主要改变是从打印检索到电子检索的转换。历来在读者期刊文献指南中发现的那种信息 ，如今是可访问的，比如，信息访谈（节目），一个系统有三种形式可供选择：（a）如一个没有正文的电子书目的指南，（b）如一个可在CD上获得一些正文的电子书目的指南，（c）如一个完整的在线服务。系统的第一和第二种形式被使用的地方，研究者们仍然大量利用期刊和缩微平片记录的装订副本。信息访谈一般可在公共图书馆和小型学术图书馆获得。

> A number of scholarly electronic indexes are in use, particularly in academic libraries. A popular one is the General Academic Index, which covers 960 scholarly titles in the arts and humanities as well as in the sciences and social sciences. This source indexes many of the same general periodicals as InfoTrak, but it also includes many scholarly journals not indexed there.  Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw are the most widely used legal indexes. Other technical indexes include PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments \(HAPI\), and two specialized indexes from Medline: PubMed and Internet Grateful Med. The World  Wide Web offers many other sources of information.

大量学术电子索引正在使用中，特别是在大学图书馆。通用学术索引是受欢迎的一个，它覆盖了在艺术与人文和科学与社会科学领域的960个学术标题。这种资源索引与信息访谈的大多数通用期刊相同，但是它也包括了许多没有被编索引的学术期刊。Lexis-Nexis（词汇在线新闻数据平台）和Westlaw（西方法律系统）是最普遍适用使用合法的索引的。其他技术的索引包括心理学信息，健康和社会心理的工具，以及Medline（医学情报联机系统）中两种特殊的索引：PubMed 和 Internet Grateful Med 。万维网提供许多其他信息的资源。

> Ask your librarian about the computer databases available to you, such as PsycINFO and PsycLIT. Also check the abstracting  services available in your library. Among the best known are Psychological Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, America: History  and Life, and Dissertation Abstracts International.

询问你的图书馆管理员关于你可获得计算机数据库，像 PsycINFO 和 PsycLIT。同时检查在你图书馆里可用的摘要服务。其中最著名的是心理学摘要、社会学摘要、美国：历史和生活、国际论文摘要。

### 互联网资源

> In the 1970s the Defense Department began coordinating research networks. Then in the 1980s the personal computer began  to gain popularity, and the research network system evolved into the Internet, also called the World Wide Web \(WWW, or  Web\). Over the years it has become a major medium of communications and learning. All you need to access the Internet is a  computer with a modem and an institutional or commercial Internet service provider \(ISP\).

在20世纪70年代，国防部开始协同研究网络。然后在20世纪80年代，个人电脑开始大受欢迎，研究网系统演变成互联网，也被成为万维网（WWW，或Web）。这些年来它已经成为交流 和学习的主要媒介。访问互联网你只需要一台有调制解调器和公共或商业的互联网服务提供商（ISP）的电脑。

> Millions of Web sites are available, but you must know the address of a site before you can access it. Also—and this is  specially important—you must enter the address exactly. \(An added space or period or letter will prevent you from reaching the  site.\) Most Web addresses begin as follows: http:\/\/www. \(If you see a Web address beginning with www, understand that this is   an abbreviation and you may have to add the first part of the address to access the site.\) If you don’t know what site is appropriate or have forgotten a Web address, you can consult one of the many available search engines, such as www.askjeeves.com.

成千上万的网站是可用的。但是在你访问它前，你必须知道它的网址。同时你必须正确地输入地址也是特别重要的。（一个额外的空格、句号或者字母将会阻止你到到达那个网站。）大多数的网站地址以http:\/\/www.开头（如果你看到一个网站地址以www开头，明白这是一个缩写。为了能够访问网站，你可能必须添加地址的第一部分。）如果你不知道什么网站合适或者忘记了网址，你可以查阅许多可获得的搜索引擎中的一个，比如www.askjeves.com。

> The ending of a Web address will tell you whether you are visiting a government site \(.gov\), an education site \(.edu\), a nonprofit organization site \(.org\), or a commercial site \(.com\). Web sites reflect the biases and\/or agendas of the people who  created them. Generally speaking, government and education sites and many nonprofit organization sites are designed to  provide the public with useful information, whereas commercial sites are designed to sell products and services. Knowing  whose site you are visiting will help you evaluate the reliability of the information you find there. Such evaluation is at least as  necessary with the Internet as it is with books and other media, perhaps more so. Here is a comprehensive but easy-to-use strategy for conducting inquiry on the Internet.

网址的结尾会告诉你你是否正在访问一个政府网站（.gov），一个教育网站（.edu），以非盈利组织网站（.org），或者一个商业网站（.com）。网站反映了创造它们的人的偏好和目的。一般而言，政府和教育网站和许多非盈利组织的网站旨在为公众提供有用的信息，而商业网站则旨在销售产品和服务。知道你正在访问谁的网站，可以帮助你评估你在那里找到的信息的可靠性。对互联网进行这样的评估至少是和对书籍以及其他媒体一样必要的，或许更加必要。这里有一个全面但是易用的在互联网上进行调查的策略

* 使用搜索引擎

  > A search engine is a tool for using the Internet efficiently. All you need to do is enter the search term \(topic\) you wish to find  information about and wait a second or so for the search to be completed. The broader your search term, the more information you will receive. “Education” could produce 60 million items; “U.S. education,” perhaps 6 million items; “U.S.  education corporal punishment,” fewer than 50,000 items. So it is prudent to be precise in your choice of terms and to modify them as necessary.

  搜索引擎是有效地使用互联网的工具。你所需要做的就是输入你想要找到的有关信息的搜索关键词，等待一秒钟左右的时间完成搜索。你搜索的关键词越宽泛，你就获得越多的信息。“教育”可以产生6千万条结果；“美国教育”，或许6百条结果；“美国教育体罚”，少于5万条结果。所以在你选择的关键词上精确一点，并且必要的时候修改它们是慎重的。

  There are many search engines and even meta-search engines, which search other search engines. The following Web site, sponsored by the University of California at Berkeley, offers a clear and comprehensive explanation of the choices  and some recommendations: http:\/\/www.lib.berkeley.edu\/TeachingLib\/Guides\/Internet\/ MetaSearch.html. This Web site  recommends www.google.com and also makes favorable mention of www.alltheweb.com and www.altavista.com. \(Another good choice would be www.bing.com.\)

  有很多搜索引擎甚至能够在其他所搜引擎上搜索的元搜索引擎。下面这些网站由伯克利的加利福尼亚大学主办（赞助），提供了一个明确的并且全面的解释的选择和建议
  Once you type in Google’s address, the first thing you should do is acquaint yourself with its features. Click, in turn, on  each of the terms in blue and read the explanation that appears. Note that “News” enables you to “search and browse  4,000 continuously updated news sources.” Next, return to the main page and type each of these phrases in turn \(without  the quotation marks\): “Google Glossary” and “Google Sets.” Read each and then return to the main page.

  Next, type “U.S. education corporal punishment” in the search box and click on “Google Search.” Keep in mind that, since  new information is constantly being added and deleted from Web sites, no two searches will receive exactly the same  response.

  Scroll down the page and scan the listings. \(Note the page specification at the bottom. Clicking on another page number  will produce additional listings.\) When you see a listing that interests you, click on the blue title. When you are through  reading that one, click the back arrow to return to the Google Search screen, and click another title. Any time you decide  that an entry is just what you are looking for, click on the words “similar pages” that appear at the end of the entry and  Google will narrow your search further.

  A word of caution: When a listing proves to be helpful, be sure to copy its address before closing it. That way, if you want  to revisit it, you can do so easily. Also record the date you visited it. \(Any citation of a Web site in a footnote should include  the phrase “accessed on \[date\].”\)
