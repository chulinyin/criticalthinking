> Whenever possible, we should consult our own experience and observation. Even if what has happened to us or what we have seen happen to others pertains only indirectly to the issue or touches on just one aspect of it, it should not be overlooked. Our observation of how people use stereotypes or face-saving maneuvers in everyday situations can help us evaluate a political candidate’s speech or a party’s platform. Our experience with conformity in ourselves and our friends can provide us with an insight into the effects of TV programming on the public. Being alert to the relevance of our experience to the issue we are investigating not only can give us valuable ideas but also can suggest important questions. Thus it can provide our inquiry with better direction.

只要有可能，我们应该借鉴我们自身的经验和观察。但即使在我们身上发生（或者我们看见在其他人身上发生）的事对问题仅仅是间接相关或者仅仅关系到问题的一个方面，这就不应该被忽略。我们对人们怎样在日常生活中使用墨守成规的观念和保全面子的措施的观察，可以帮助我们评价一场政治候选人的演讲或者一场排队的舞台。

> Of course, our own experience and observation will seldom be adequate by itself, especially on complex and controversial matters. We will need to consult other sources. What follows is a brief guide to what to look for and where to find it.
