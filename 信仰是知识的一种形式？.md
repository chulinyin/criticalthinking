> Some readers, particularly religious conservatives, may wonder whether what has been said thus far about knowledge represents a denunciation of faith. Their concern is understandable, given the number of intellectuals in this and previous centuries who have dismissed religion as mere superstition. But no such denunciation is intended here. The relationship between knowledge and religious faith is both complex and subtle. The term religious faith by definition suggests belief in something that cannot be proved. This is not to say that what is believed is not true, but only that its truth cannot be demonstrated conclusively. Jews \(and many others\) believe that God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, Muslims believe that Muhammad is Allah’s prophet, and Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Science is simply not applicable to these beliefs. Philosophy can offer complementary arguments for or against them but cannot prove or disprove them.

一些读者，特别是宗教保守派，可能想知道目前为止所说的知识是否代表对信仰的谴责。鉴于这个和过去几个世纪中把宗教视为迷信的知识分子的数量，他们的关心是可以理解的。但是这里没有故意的谴责。知识和宗教信仰的关系既复杂又微妙。按照定义，宗教信仰这一术语是指对一些无法被证明的东西的信念。这并不是说被相信的东西不是真的，而只是说它的真理不能被不容置疑地证明。犹太人（以及许多其他人）相信神给予了摩西十戒，穆斯林相信穆罕默德是真主安拉的先知，基督教徒相信耶稣基督是上帝的儿子。科学根本不适用于这些信念。哲学家可以为他们提供互补或者反对的证据，但是无法证明或者反驳他们。

> Mortimer Adler, a distinguished philosopher, offers a very useful insight into the nature of faith:

著名哲学家 Mortimer Adler 对信仰的本质提供了一个非常有用的深刻见解。

* > What is usually called a “leap of faith” is needed to carry anyone across the chasm \[between philosophy and religion\]. But the leap of faith is usually misunderstood as being a progress from having insufficient reasons for affirming God’s existence to a state of greater certitude in that affirmation. That is not the case. The leap of faith consists in going from the conclusion of a merely philosophical theology to a religious belief in a God that has revealed himself as a loving, just and merciful Creator of the cosmos, a God to be loved, worshiped and prayed to.20

  需要通常所说的“信仰飞跃”来带领任何人跨过哲学和宗教之间的鸿沟。但信仰飞跃通常被误解为从没有足够理由肯定上帝存在到`确信那个断言状态`的进步。事实并非如此。“信仰飞跃”存在于从一个仅仅哲学的神学结论，走到对一个显示自己充满爱、公正和仁慈的宇宙创造者的上帝的宗教信仰，为了被爱而敬奉并祷告上帝。

> A related concern of religious conservatives may be whether they are compromising their faith by embracing the philosophical position expressed in this chapter. Each of us must, of course, answer this question for himself or herself. Before deciding, however, we would do well to consider the argument advanced by Mark Noll, a leading evangelical scholar. In spurning philosophical investigation, he says, evangelicals not only have removed themselves from the discussion of issues vital to all people but also have lost touch with “the habits of mind that for nearly two centuries defined the evangelical experience in America.” In his view, that has proved to be a tragic mistake.21

宗教保守派关心的可能是他们接受本章表达的哲学立场是否会令他们的信仰受到损害。当然，我们每个人都必须为自己回答这个问题。然而，在决定之前我们最好考虑一下著名福音派学者 Mak Noll 提出的论点。他说，在拒绝哲学调查研究过程中，福音派不仅将他们自己从对所有人都极其重要的问题的讨论中移除，还与“近两个世纪定义的美国福音派经验的思维习惯”失去联系。在他看来，这已经证明是一个悲剧性的错误。
