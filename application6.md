一、想象你是你大学的高级图书管理员。一位教职工给你发送了以下推荐杂志清单，每本都有来引用自BillKatz 和 Linda Sternberg Katz 的图书馆杂志标准指南的一句简短描述。

* > ._The Nation._“This is the foremost liberal/left-wing journal, and the standard by which all other liberal publications should be judged . . . unabashedly partisan.”
  >
  > _Human Events._“The editor makes no claims about impartiality. . . . The editorial tone is decidedly conservative, particularly when discussing Congress.”
  >
  > \_Free Inquiry:\_A Secular Humanist Magazine. “The articles in this journal strongly reflect the position of CODESH \[the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism\] and tend to be more anti–organized religion than positively secular humanist.”
  >
  > \_Paidika:\_The Journal of Paedophilia. “Paidika is a journal intended for academics studying human sexuality as well as for pedophiles and pederasts discovering a history and an identity.”

  国家： “这是最重要的自由党/左翼杂志，也是所有其他自由党出版物的评判标准，不加掩饰的党派。”

  人类事件：“编辑对公正没有任何要求…社论语调是绝对保守的，特别是在讨论国会的时候。”

  自由探索：“世俗的人文主义杂志。”该杂志中的文章强烈反映了民主会议和世俗人文主义的立场，倾向于成为反对组织的宗教而不是积极的世俗人文主义者。

  Paidika：恋童癖杂志。“它是一本为让学者研究人类性和让恋童癖者、恋童癖男子发现历史和身份的杂志。”

> Background note: A Rochester, New York, lawyer issued a court challenge to the practice of charging women half price for drinks during “ladies’ nights” at bars. He argued that the practice is a form of sex discrimination against men.20

背景说明：一个纽约罗彻斯特的律师对酒吧在“女士之夜”期间向女人收取半价饮料的做法发出了法庭挑战。他认为这种做法是一种对男性性别歧视的形式。

* > Henrietta: That lawyer must be making a joke against feminism. He can’t be serious.

  Henrietta：那个律师一定要开玩笑反对女权主义。他不能严肃啊。

  > Burt: Why not? It’s clearly a case of discrimination.

  Burt：为什么不行？这显然是一个性别歧视的例子。

  > Henrietta: Look, we both know why ladies’ nights are scheduled in bars: as a gimmick to attract customers. The women flock to the bars to get cheap drinks, and the men flock there because the women are there. It’s no different from other gimmicks, such as mud-wrestling contests and “two for the price of one” cocktail hours.

  Henrietta：看，我们都知道为什么女士之夜被安排在酒吧：作为一个吸引顾客的花招而已。女人聚集到酒吧，喝便宜的饮料，男人同时也据聚集在那里，因为女人在那里。这和其它花招没有两样，如泥地摔跤比赛和“买二送一”的鸡尾酒时刻。

  > Burt: Sorry. It’s very different from two-for-one cocktail hours, where a person of either sex can buy a cocktail at the same price. Ladies’ nights set a double standard based on sex and that’s sex discrimination, pure and simple.

  Burt：不好意思。这和买二送一的鸡尾酒时刻完全不一样，因为那里任何性别的人都可以用同样的价格买一杯鸡尾酒。而女士之夜基于性别设立了双重标准，而那纯粹就是性别歧视，

  > Henrietta: So now you’re a great foe of discrimination. How come you’re not complaining that men haven’t got an equal opportunity to participate half naked in mud-wrestling contests? And why aren’t you protesting the fact that women are paid less for doing the same jobs men do? You’re a phony, Burt, and you make me sick.

  Henrietta：所以现在你是性别歧视的伟大敌人。那你怎么不抗议男人没有平等的机会参加半裸泥地摔跤比赛？你为什么不抗议女人和男人做同样的工作却报酬更少的事实。Burt，你是个伪君子，你让我恶心。

  > Burt: Name-calling is not a sign of a strong intellect. And why you should get so emotional over some lawyer’s protest, I can’t imagine. I guess it goes to show that women are more emotional than men.

  Burt：骂人并不是一个有头脑的标志。而且我无法想象，为什么你会对一些律师的抗议如此情绪化。我猜那表明女人比男人更情绪化。
