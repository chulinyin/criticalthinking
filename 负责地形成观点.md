> One of the things that makes human beings vastly more complex and interesting than cows or trees is their ability to form opinions. Forming opinions is natural. Even if we wanted to stop doing so, we couldn’t. Nor should we want to. This ability has two sides, however. It can either lift us to wisdom or mire us in shallowness or even absurdity. Here are some tips that can help you improve the quality of your opinions:

使人类比牛或者树更复杂和有趣的事情之一是他们形成观点的能力。形成观点是天生的。即使我们想要停止这样做，也不能。我们也不应该想要这样做。然而，这个能力有两面。它可以提高我们的智慧或者让我们陷入肤浅或甚至荒谬中。一下一些提示可以帮助你提高你观点的质量：

1. > Understand how opinions are formed. Like every other human being,you are constantly perceiving—that is, receiving data through your senses. Also like everyone else, you have a natural drive to discover meaning in your perceptions. That drive can be enhanced or suppressed, but it can never be entirely lost. In practical terms, this means that you can not help producing opinions about what you see and hear whether or not you take control of the process. When you are not in control, your mental system operates in the uncritical default mode. Here is how that uncritical mode compares with the conscious and more conscientious critical thinking mode:

   | Uncritical Default Mode Perceive | Critical Thinking Mode Perceive |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | Let an opinion “come to mind” | Investigate the issue |
   | Focus on information that supports the opinion | Consider alternative opinions |
   | Embrace the opinion | Decide which opinion is most reasonable |

   理解观点是如何形成的。就像其他人一样，你在不断感知——即，通过你的感官接收数据。也像其他任何人一样，你有发现你所感知的意义的本能欲望。这种欲望可以被增强或者抑制，但它永远不会完全失去。实际上，这意味着不论你是否控制这个过程，你都会情不自禁地对你看到和听到的东西产生观点。当你失控的时候，你的精神系统以非理性的默认模式运转。以下是非理性模式与有意识和更认真的理性思维模式的比较

   | 非理性的默认模式感知 | 理性默认感知 |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | 让一个观点“来到脑中” | 调查问题 |
   | 关注于支持该观点的信息 | 考虑可供替代的观点 |
   | 接受该观点 | 决定哪个观点更合理 |

2. > Resist the temptation to treat your opinions as facts. This temptation can be powerful. Once you’ve formed an opinion, it is natural to bond with it, much as a parent bonds with a baby. The more you call your opinion to mind and express it to others, the stronger the bond becomes. To question its legitimacy soon becomes unthinkable. Nevertheless, you can be sure that some of your opinions have been uncritically formed and therefore need to be challenged. The problem is that you can’t be sure which ones those are. The prudent approach is to question any opinion, even a cherished one, the moment evidence arises that suggests it is based on habit, impulse, whim, personal preference, or the influence of fashionable ideas rather than reality.

   抵抗把你的观点看作事实的诱惑。这种诱惑可以非常强大。一旦你形成了一个观点，它会天生与之联系在一起，就像父母与孩子。你越在脑中呼唤你的观点并将之表达给别人，这种纽带就越强。质疑它的合理性很快变得不可想象。尽管如此，你可以确信你的一些观点是不加批判地形成的，因此需要被挑战。问题是你不能确信它们中的哪些是。谨慎的方法是，一旦出现证据表明一个观点是基于习惯、冲动、突发奇想、个人偏好或者时髦观点的影响，而不是基于现实时，质疑它，即使它是一个珍爱的观点，

3. > Monitor your thoughts to prevent the uncritical default mode from taking charge. Whenever you begin forming impressions of a person, place, or situation, follow the advice of the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus: “Be not swept off your feet by the vividness of the impression, but say, ‘Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are and what you represent. Let me try \[test\] you.’” This approach will prevent your impressions from hardening into opinions before you determine their reasonableness.

   监视你的思维，阻止非理性的默认模式接管。每当你开始对一个人、地方或者场景形成印象时，遵循古希腊哲学家爱比克泰德的建议：“不要神魂颠倒于生动的印象，而说，‘印象，等我一会儿。让我看看你是什么，你代表了什么。让我试着检验你。’ ”这个方法将在你确定印象的合理性前，阻止其硬化为观点。

> By following these three steps, you will gain control of your opinions, and that is a considerable advantage over having them control you.

通过遵循这三步 ，你将获得对你的观点的控制，这与让他们控制你相比是相当大的优势。
