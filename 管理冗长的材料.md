Often your inquiry will take you beyond editorials and brief essays to full-length articles and books. These longer works are  more difficult to evaluate because the core arguments are seldom presented neatly and compactly. The authors of these  arguments do not intend to make analysis difficult—it is simply the nature of the writing process. Responsible authors of journal  articles and books do not merely present lists of bald assertions; they support their views with evidence. They also add  sufficient explanation to satisfy the demands of clarity and define the path their reasoning has taken. Sometimes the path has  numerous turns, so seondary assertions must be added to complement and refine primary ones. As anecdotes multiply, as experimental and statistical data are reported and annotated, and as testimony is detailed, the essential argument can become  almost as concealed as the hidden premises it sometimes contains. One premise may be stated on page 2, another on page  5, and the conclusion on page 12. Before you can evaluate the argument in these cases, you need to consolidate it. Here is a  strategy for doing so:

通常你的调查会带你超越社论和短篇文章到长篇文章和书籍。这些较长的作品是更难以评估的，因为核心论点很少是整齐紧凑地呈现。这些论点的作者不是要使分析变得困难——它只是写作过程的本质。**负责任的期刊文章和书籍作者不仅仅列出毫无掩饰的主张清单；他们用证据支持他们的观点。他们还添加了足够的解释，以满足清晰的要求，并阐明他们的推理所采取的路径。有时这条路径有无数的转弯，所以必须添加次要主张以补充和优化主要的主张。**随着轶事倍增，随着实验和统计数据被报告和注解，随着证词变得详细，基本的论点会变得几乎像它有时包含的一些隐藏前提那样隐藏。一个前提可能在第2页说，另一个前提在第二页，结论在12页。在你可以评估这些情况下的论点之前，你需要去合并它。这里是这样做的策略：

1. After reading the article or book, go back and identify the key assertions. Most paragraphs contain one or more assertions  \(topic sentences\). Scan these and determine which are central to the argument. Subheadings usually signal important  assertions, as do capital letters, boldface, and italics. Look, too, for intensifying words such as moreover, indeed, more \(most\) important, and more \(most\) significant.

2. Identify the author’s conclusion. The conclusion may appear anywhere, but commonly it appears as follows: in an article—right  after the introduction, in the conclusion, or in both places; in a book—in the first or second chapter, in the last chapter, or in  both places. Expressions like for these reasons, thus, consequently, so, and therefore signal conclusions.

3. Notice any qualifying words used in the key assertions or the conclusion. Is the writer speaking of all people, places, or things?  Or is she speaking of most, many, some, several, a few, or certain specified ones? Is she saying always, usually, sometimes,  occasionally, seldom, never, or at certain specified times? Often writers will make an assertion and then balance it in the next  sentence. They often lead into the second sentence with words like but, however, nevertheless, on the other hand, still, or yet.

4. Note the amount, kinds, and sources of evidence used to support the assertions. Chapter 6 discussed numerous kinds of  evidence. Review that chapter, if necessary.

5. Notice the conditions the author includes. Saying, for example, “Drug pushers should be given long jail terms if they are not  themselves drug users and have been previously convicted of drug pushing” is very different from saying, “Drug pushers  should be given long jail terms.” The “if” clause adds a special set of conditions. Similarly, saying, “The United States should  never fire a nuclear missile at another country unless first subjected to nuclear attack by that country” is quite different from  saying, “The United States should never fire a nuclear missile at another country.” Expressions like if, unless, as long as, until,  and before can significantly alter the meaning of an assertion.

6. Compose an accurate summary of the article or book from your analysis in steps 1–5. This enables you to focus your attention  and analyze the argument. The summary needn’t be long; a paragraph or two is adequate in most cases. The summary should  be a capsule version of the original work. \(There is no room for carelessness in quoting or paraphrasing the original: If it says  something may be a certain way, it is not saying that it is that way; similarly, is does not necessarily mean should be.\) Here is sample summary of an article recommending the abolition of grades. Although it extended to more than ten printed pages in  the original, it is here condensed into a single paragraph without sacrificing accuracy.

  * One of the biggest obstacles to learning—in grade school, high school, and college—is grades. The fear of bad grades hangs  over the heads of young people from the time they are six to the time they are twenty or twenty-two. Their anxiety to do well, to  succeed, to please their parents so fills their minds that all the natural joy in learning evaporates. As a result, conscientious  students are driven to view their schoolwork as oppressive drudgery, and marginal students are tempted to cheat and bluff  their way to a degree. For these reasons I say grades should be abolished at all levels of education.
