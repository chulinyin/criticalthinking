> So far, we’ve established that people can be mistaken in what they perceive and remember and that the information they receive can be faulty or incomplete. But these matters concern individuals. What of group judgment—the carefully analyzed observations of the best thinkers, the wisest men and women of the time? Is that record better? Happily, it is.But it, too, leaves a lot to be desired.

到目前为止，我们已经证实人们察觉或记得的事情可能是错的，并且他们接收的信息可能是错误或者不完整的。但是这些事情涉及个人。`那群体判断——最优秀的思考者的仔细分析观察，当时最聪明的人，那被更好地记录吗？`幸运的是，是的。但是，也有许多需要改进。

> All too often, what is taken as truth one day by the most respected minds is proved erroneous the next. You undoubtedly know of some examples. In the early seventeenth century, when Galileo suggested that the sun is the center of our solar system, he was charged with heresy, imprisoned, and pressured to renounce his error. The “truth” of that time, accepted by every scientist worthy of the name, was that the earth was the center ofthe solar system.

很多时候，有一天被大多数令人尊敬的头脑视为真理的东西，之后被证明是错误的。你无疑知道一些例子。在17世纪初， 当伽利略认为太阳是我们太阳系的中心的时候，他被指控为异端邪说，被囚禁并被强迫宣布放弃他的错误。那时被每个科学家接受的名副其实的“真理”是，地球是太阳系的中心。

> Here are some other examples you may not have heard about in which the “truth” turned out not to be true:

这里是一些其它你可能没有听说过的例子，在这些例子中“真理”结果不是真的：

* > For a long time surgeons used talc on the rubber gloves they wore while performing surgery. Then they discovered it could be poisonous. So they switched to starch, only to find that it, too, could have a toxic effect on surgical patients.5

  长期以来，外科医生在他们进行外科手术时穿的橡胶手套上使用滑石粉。接着他们发现它可能是有毒的。所以他们改用淀粉，仅仅发现它也可能对外科手术的病人有不良作用。

* > Film authorities were certain they were familiar with all the films the late Charlie Chaplin ever made. Then, in 1982, a previously unknown film was discovered in a British screen archive vault. 6

  电影专家确定他们对已故查理·卓别林曾制作的所有电影都是熟悉的。接着，在 1982年， 一部之前未知的电影在一个英国屏幕档案库被发现。

* > For hundreds of years historians believed that although the people of Pompeii had been trapped by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius inA.D. 79, the people of neighboring Herculaneum had escaped. Then the discovery of eighty bodies \(and the hint of hundreds more\) under the volcanic ash revealed that many from Herculaneum had also been trapped.7

  数百年来，历史学家认为，虽然庞培人在公元79年被喷发的维苏威火山困住，但是相邻的赫库兰尼姆人逃脱了。接着，在火山灰下发现的80具尸体（和超数百个暗示），显示许多来自赫库兰尼姆的人也被困住了。


* > Your grandparents probably learned that there are eight planets in our solar system. Since Pluto was discovered in 1930, your parents and you learned there are nine. Then Joseph L. Brady of the University of California suggested there might be ten.8 But more recently Pluto was removed from the list.

  你的祖父母可能知道在我们的太阳系中有8颗行星。自从冥王星在1930年被发现，你的父母和你知道有9颗。接着加利福尼亚大学的 Joseph L. Brady 认为可能是10颗。但是最近冥王星被从列表中移除了。 

* > After mor phine was used by doctors for some years as a pain killer,it was found to be addictive. The search began for a nonaddictive substitute. What was found to take its place? Heroin!9

  在吗啡被医生作为止痛药使用几年后，发现它使人上瘾。搜寻不致瘾的替代品开始了。找到了什么取代它的位置呢？海洛因！
