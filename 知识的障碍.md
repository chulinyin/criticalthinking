> Before we discuss how knowledge is best sought, let’s consider two habits that impede knowledge: assuming and guessing. Assuming is taking something for granted—that is, arbitrarily accepting as true something that has not been proved or that may reasonably be disputed. Because assuming is generally an unconscious activity, we are often unaware of our assumptions and their influence on us.\* The main negative effect of unrecognized assumptions is that they stifle the curiosity that leads to knowledge.

在我们讨论如何最好地寻求知识前，让我们考虑阻碍知识的两个习惯：假定和猜测。假定是指认为某些东西是理所当然的——即武断地将一些尚未证明或者仍有争议的事作为真理接受。因为假定通常是一种无意识的活动，我们经常没有意识到我们的假定及其对我们的影响。忽视假定的主要负面影响是，它们扼杀了通往知识的好奇心。

* > \*It is, of course, possible to raise assumptions to the conscious level and express them. Most scientific references to assumptions are made in this context.

  把假定提高到意识层面并表达它们当然是有可能的。在上下文中大多数是对假定的科学引用。

> Many people, for example, never speculate about the daily life of fish. They may occasionally stop at the pet store in the mall and stare at the tank of tropical fish. But they may never display curiosity about the social roles and relationships of fish communities because they assume fish have no such roles or relationships. Yet the fact is, in the words of under-water sociologist C. Lavett Smith, “There are fish equivalents of barbers,policemen, and farmers. Some are always on the move and others are sedentary. Some work at night and some by day.”22

例如，许多人从不猜测鱼的日常生活。他们可能偶尔驻足在商场的宠物店，盯着热带鱼缸。但他们可能永远不会对鱼社区的社会角色和关系表现出好奇，因为他们假定鱼没有这种角色或者关系。然而事实是，正如水下社会学家 C. Lavett Simth 所说，“鱼一样有理发师、警察和农民。有的总是在移动，而其他则习惯久坐。有的在晚上工作而一些则在白天。”

> Guessing is offering a judgment on a hunch or taking a chance on an answer without any confidence that it is correct. It’s a common, everyday activity. For students who don’t study for exams, it’s a last-ditch survival technique. For an example of guessing, though, let’s take a more pleasant subject—drinking beer. Some time ago a professor of behavioral science at a California college conducted a beer taste test among his students. The issue was whether they could really tell a good beer from a bad one or their favorite from others. Many students likely would guess they could,and a number of participants in the test actually guessed they could tell. However, the test showed that when the samples were not labeled, notone student could identify a single brand.23

猜测是凭直觉提供判断或者在回答上冒险而没有任何证据证明它是对的。这在日常活动中是常见的。对于那些不为考试学习的学生而言，这是一项最后的生存技术。举个猜测的例子，让我们用一个更愉快的主题——喝啤酒。前段时间，加利福尼亚大学的行为科学教授在他的学生中进行了一次啤酒测试。问题是他们是否能够真正地从坏酒中辨别出好酒，或者从中辨别出自己最喜爱的酒。许多学生可能会猜测他们可以，而且许多参加测试的人也真的猜测他们可以辨别。然而，测试表明，当样品没有被贴上标签时，没有一个学生能够认出一个品牌。

> Because assuming stifles curiosity and guessing denies the importance of evidence, neither is likely to lead to knowledge. The most reliable approach is to be cautious in asserting that you know something. Be conservative in your level of assertion—whenever you are less than certain,speak about possibilities and probabilities. Say, “I think” or “It seems to me” rather than “I know.” Most important, be honest with yourself and others about your ignorance. To admit you don’t know something shows good sense, restraint, and intellectual honesty. These are not weaknesses but strengths. The admission of ignorance is the essential first step towardknowledge.

由于假定扼杀了好奇心，猜测否认了证据的重要性，所以两个都不可能通往知识。最可靠的方法是谨慎地断言你知道某事；在你的断言水平上保守——只要你不确定，就说可能性和概率。说，“我认为”或者“在我看来”而不是“我知道”。最重要的是，在你自己的无知上对自己和他人诚实。承认你不知道某些东西显示出判断力强、克制、心智成熟。这些不是弱点而是优点。承认无知是迈向知识的重要的第一步。

> Does this mean you should be wishy-washy and hedge everything you say with maybes and perhapses? Does it mean that to be a critical thinker you must forsake convictions? The answer to both questions is an emphatic no! It means only that you should value firm, bold statements so much that you reserve them for occasions when the evidence permits. Similarly, you should value convictions so highly that you embrace them only when you have sufficient knowledge to do so and that you modify them whenever intellectual honesty requires.

这是否意味着你应该没有主见，回避任何你说的可能和也许？这是否意味着成为一个理性思考者，你必须抛弃信念？这两个问题的答案显然都是不！这只是意味着你应该多评估坚定、醒目的声明以便当证据允许时你预留了理由。类似的，你应该高度评估鉴定信念以便只有当你有足够的知识这样做的时候才接受他们，以及每当理智的诚实需要时修改它们。
