> Inquiry is seeking answers to questions, investigating issues, and gathering information to help us draw conclusions. It enables us to get beyond our first impressions, feelings, preconceived notions, and personal preferences.

调查是寻找问题的答案，调查问题，收集信息，用以帮助我们得出结论。它使我们能够超越我们的第一印象、感觉、先入为主的观念和个人的偏好。

> There are two basic kinds of inquiry: inquiry into facts and inquiry into opinions. Opinions, remember, can be informed or uninformed. Except in cases where the purpose of our inquiry demands that both varieties of opinion be gathered, we should be more interested in informed opinion.

有两种基本类型的调查：对事实的调查和对观点的调查。记住， 观点可以是有根据的或者无根据的。除非我们调查的目的要求收集两种观点，否则我们应该对有根据的观点更感兴趣。

> Often we will need to inquire into both facts and opinions. How much inquiry into each is needed will, of course, vary from situation to situation. If the specific issue were Which U.S. income group is most inequitably treated by the present federal tax laws? we would have to examine the tax laws to determine what they specify \( fact\) and consult the tax experts for their interpretations of the more complicated aspects of the laws \(informed opinion\). But to determine the degree of inequity, we would have to know the amount of income necessary to provide living essentials \(food, shelter, and clothing\). So we would also have to examine cost-of-living statistics \( fact\) and consult economists about subtler factors affecting the various income groups \(informed opinion\).

通常我们需要对事实和观点都调查。每个需要多少调查，当然，因情况而异。如果具体问题是哪个美国收入群体是被目前联邦税法最不公平对待的？我们将不得不调查税法，以确定他们所指定的内容（事实） ，并向税务专家咨询他们对法律更为复杂方面的解释（有根据的观点）。但是为了确定不平等程度，我们将必须知道提供生活必需品（食物、住所和衣服）所需的收入。所以我们还必须调查生活费的统计（事实），并咨询经济学家关于影响不同收入群体的微妙因素（有根据的观点）。
