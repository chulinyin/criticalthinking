> 1. Think of a recent situation in which someone referred in appropriately to“my truth.” Write two or three paragraphs, in your own words, explaining to that person what you learned in this chapter.

一、想想最近的情况，有人提到了“我的真理”。用你自己的话写两到三段话，向那个人解释你在本章学到了什么。

> 2. A central question in sociology is How does society evolve? Three well-known individuals gave very different answers. Auguste Comte \(1798–1857\)suggested that it involved three stages: religious, metaphysical, and scientific.Herbert Spencer \(1820–1903\) claimed that it followed Darwinian “natural selection,” in which only the fittest survive. Karl Marx \(1818–1883\) argued that it occurred through class conflict as a result of economic exploitation. Would belief in relativism—the idea that everyone creates his or her own truth—increase or decrease someone’s motivation to analyze these three viewpoints and pursue the question of society’s evolution? Explain your response.

二、社会学中的一个核心问题是社会是如何进化的？三个著名的人给出了非常不同的答案。 Auguste Comte \(1798–1857\) 认为它涉及三个阶段：宗教、形而上学和科学。Herbert Spencer \(1820–1903\) 声称它遵从达尔文的“自然选择”，适者生存。Karl Marx \(1818–1883\) 主张它通过经济剥削的结果——阶级斗争发生。对相对主义观念——每个人创造他或她自己的真理的信念，会增长还是减少某些人分析这三个观点并追求社会进化的大难的积极性？解释你的回答。

> 3. Read each of the following passages,decide how reasonable it is,and explain your thinking.

三、阅读下面每段话，判断其合理性，并解释你的想法。

1. > People who believe that“everyone creates his or her own truth”should never argue with anyone about anything. If they do, they are being inconsistent.

   相信“每个人创造他／她自己的真理”的人不该和任何人讨论任何事。如果他们这样做了，他们是自相矛盾的。

2. > Motivation to do anything depends on the belief that it has not yet been done. Everyone who loses something precious, say a diamond ring, will search diligently and even desperately until it is found. But only a fool would continue searching for it after it was found. It is no different with other kinds of searches, such as the search for truth. Once we think we have it, we stop looking.

   做任何事的积极性取决于它还没有完成的信念。每个丢失珍贵东西（如一个钻戒）的人都会努力甚至拼命地找，直到找到为止。但是只有笨蛋才会在找到它后还继续找。这与其他类型的寻找没有区别，例如寻找真理。一旦我们认为我们拥有它了，我们会停止寻找。


> 4. For years grade school students faced this question on their science tests:“ True or False—The famous rings of the planet Saturn are composed of solid material.” If the students marked “true,” they lost credit, because the “truth”was that Saturn’s rings were composed of gas or dust. Then, in 1973, radar probes revealed that all those wrong answers had been right. Saturn’s rings are,in fact, composed of solid matter.12 This confusing case seems to suggest that the truth changed. Did it really? Explain.

四、多年以来小学生们在他们的科学考试中面对这个问题：“对或错——著名的土星环由固体物质组成。”如果学生们打勾，他们失去分数，因为“真理”是土星环是由气体和尘埃组成的。接着，在1973年，雷达探测器显示哪些所有错误的回答是正确的。事实上，土星环是由固体物质组成的。这个令人困惑的例子似乎暗示着真理改变了。它真的变了吗？解释一下。

> 5. The scene is a campus security office,where two students are being questioned. A few minutes earlier, they were engaged in a fistfight in the cafeteria. The campus police ask them again and again how the fight started. The stories conflict. Because each student seems genuinely convinced that the other one was the aggressor and there were no witnesses, the campus police have no hope of discovering the truth. But is there a truth to discover? Or are there two truths, one for each student’s story? What light does the chapter shed on these questions?

五、场景是一个学校安全办公室，两个学生正在被问话。几分钟前，他们在自主食堂参与了打架。校园警卫一遍又一遍地问他们打架是如何发生的。故事是矛盾的。因为每个学生似乎都真诚地确信另外一个人是挑衅者而且没有目击者，校园警卫没有发现真相的希望。但是有真相可以发现吗？还是有两个真相，每人一个？本章在这些问题上流露出哪些启发？

> 6. A strange phenomenon that affects a tiny number of the world’s inhabitants has interested psychologists for some time. It occurs during what Norwegians call the “murky time,” the two months each year during which areas above the Arctic Circle experience almost unrelieved darkness. The effects on people have been discovered to be unfortunate, even dangerous. At worst, people experience severe tenseness, restlessness, fear, a preoccupation with thoughts of death and even suicide. At best, they experience an inability to concentrate, fatigue, a lack of enthusiasm for anything, suspicion, and jealousy. Part of the cause is seen as lack of sleep. Accustomed to day and night, people become confused by constant darkness.13 This phenomenon poses an interesting test of truth. Would it be proper to say the phenomenon was true before it was recognized and acknowledged by psychologists? Or did it become true only when they became aware of it? And what of your relationship to the phenomenon? Before you became aware of it for the first time, whether reading it here or elsewhere, it was not “true to you.” But did that make it any less true? Explain in light of this chapter.

六、一个影响了世界上极小数量居民的奇怪现象让心理学家感兴趣有一段时间了。它发生在挪威人称之为“黑暗时期”期间，每年两个月期间，北极圈以上的地区经历了几乎无边的黑暗。已经发现这对人的影响是不幸，甚至危险的。在最坏的情况下，人们经历严重的紧张、不安、恐惧、全神贯注地思考死亡甚至自杀。在最好的情况下，他们经历了不能集中精神、疲劳、缺乏对任何事物的热情，怀疑和嫉妒。部分原因被认为是缺少睡眠。习惯于白天黑夜，人们对持续的黑暗感到迷惑。这个现象构成了一个有趣的真理测试。在这个现象被心理学家认识和承认之前说它是真的是合适的吗？还是只有当他们开始意识到它时，它才成为真的？你和这个现象的关系是什么？在你首次意识到它之前，是否在这里或者哪里读过，它“对你不是真的”。但这是否使它不那么真实？根据本章解释。

> \7. Evaluate the following dialogues in light of what you learned in this chapter. If you lack sufficient knowledge to judge the issue, do some research.

七、按照你在本章所学，评估下面的对话。如果你缺少足够的知识去判断问题，做一些研究。

1. > Martha: I don’t care what the courts say about abortion—I’m convinced it’s murder because the fetus is a human being.

   Martha：我不在乎法庭关于堕胎说了什么——我确信它是谋杀，因为胎儿也是一个人。

   > Marian: If you want to believe that, fine. Just don’t impose your beliefs on others and prevent them from exercising their rights.

   Marian：如果你想要相信那个，很好。只是不要把你的信念强加给别人以及阻止他们行使自己的权利。

   > Martha: You don’t seem to understand. It’s not just a fetus in my uterus that’s human but the fetus in the uterus of every pregnant woman.

   Martha: 你好像不明白。这不只是我子宫里的一个胎儿，这是一个人，`而是每位孕妇子宫里的胎儿`。

   > Marian: Nonsense. You have no right to classify what exists in someone else’s uterus. That’s her business. You should mind your own business.

   Marian: 胡说。你没有权利对其他人子宫中存在的东西分类。那是她的事情。你应该管好自己的事情。

2. > Barbi:Television shows about suicide should not be aired.

   Barbi: 关于自杀的电视节目不应该被播出。

   > Ken: Why?

   Ken: 为什么？

   > Barbi: Because they cause people to commit suicide.

   Barbi: 因为它们会造成人们自杀。

   > Ken: That’s ridiculous. How can a drama or documentary that shows the tragedy of suicide cause people to commit suicide?

   Ken: 荒唐。一个展示自杀悲剧的戏剧或者纪录片如何能造成人们自杀呢？

   > Barbi: I don’t know how it happens. Maybe some people have thoughts of suicide already and the show reinforces them. Or maybe they focus on the act of suicide and lose sight of the tragedy. All I know is that attempted suicides increase after the airing of such shows.

   Barbi: 我不知道这是如何发生的。或许某些人已经有自杀的想法了，接着这些节目强化了这些想法。或者可能他们聚焦于自杀的行为而忽视了悲剧。所有我知道的是，在这些节目播出之后，自杀未遂的人数增加了。

3. > Mabel: I notice that when you get a newspaper you immediately turn to the astrology column. Do you really believe that nonsense?

   Mabel: 我注意到当你拿到一张报纸的时候，你马上翻到占星术专栏。你真的相信那些胡说吗？

   > Alphonse: It’s not nonsense. The planets exercise a powerful influence on our lives; their positions in the heavens at the time of our birth can shape our destiny.

   Alphonse: 那不是胡说。行星对我们的生活产生了强大的影响；我们出生时它们在天中的位置能够塑造我们的命运。

   > Mabel: I can’t believe I’m hearing such slop from a science major.

   Mabel：我不敢相信我从一个科学专业的人里听到了这种话。

   > Alphonse: What you fail to understand is that astrology is science, one of the most ancient sciences at that.

   Alphonse：你无法理解的是占星术士是科学，最古老的科学之一。

4. > Jake: What did you think of the chapter “What Is Truth?”

   Jake：你对这章“什么是真理”有什么想法？

   > Rocky: It’s stupid.

   Rocky：愚蠢。

   > Jake: What do you mean?

   Jake: 什么意思？

   > Rocky: It contradicts Chapter 1.

   Rocky: 它和第一章矛盾。

   > Jake: I didn’t get that impression. Where’s the contradiction?

   Jake：我没有那种感觉。矛盾在哪里？

   > Rocky: In Chapter 1 the author says that we should strive to be individuals and think for ourselves. Now he says that his idea about truth is OK and ours isn’t and that we should follow his. That’s a contradiction.

   Rocky: 在第一章，作者说我们应该力争成为个体并且独立思考。现在他说他关于真理的观念是可行的，我们的不是，并且我们应该遵从他的。这是一个矛盾。


> \8. Group discussion exercise: How many times have you been certain something was true, only to find out later that it was not? Discuss those experienceswith two or three classmates. Be prepared to share the most dramatic and interesting experiences with the rest of the class.

八、小组讨论练习：你曾有多少次确定某些东西是真的，仅仅之后发现它不是真的？和两到三位同学讨论这些经历。和剩下的班级同学准备分享最戏剧性和有趣的经历。
