In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes the only, influence on children. Today, however, the  influence exerted by mass culture \(the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and popular music\) often is greater.



By age 18 the average teenager has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom and 22,000 hours in front of the television set. He or  she has had perhaps 13,000 school lessons yet has watched more than 750,000 commercials. By age thirty-five the same  person has had fewer than 20,000 school lessons yet has watched approximately 45,000 hours of television and close to 2 million commercials.



What effects does mass culture have on us? To answer, we need only consider the formats and devices commonly used in the  media. Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebrities. This approach is  designed to appeal to emotions and create artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people develop the  habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to such appeals. They also tend to acquire values very different from  those taught in the home and the school. Ads often portray play as more fulfilling than work, self-gratification as more desirable  than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.



Television programmers use frequent scene shifts and sensory appeals such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters  to keep audience interest from diminishing. Then they add frequent commercial interruptions. This author has analyzed the  attention shifts that television viewers are subjected to. In a dramatic program, for example, attention shifts might include  camera angle changes;\* shifts in story line from one set of characters \(or subplot\) to another, or from a present scene to a   past scene \(flashback\), or to fantasy; and shifts to “newsbreaks,” to commercial breaks, from one commercial to another, and  back to the program. Also included might be shifts of attention that occur within commercials. I found as many as 78 shifts per  hour, excluding the shifts within commercials. The number of shifts within commercials ranged from 6 to 54 and averaged  approximately 17 per fifteen-second commercial. The total number of attention shifts came out to over 800 per hour, or over 14 per minute.†



This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the  workplace to provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and  when it isn’t met they call their teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to  read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.



Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published authors, they are often directed to give short, dramatic  answers during promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. A man who coaches writers for talk shows  offered one client this advice: “If I ask you whether the budget deficit is a good thing or a bad thing, you should not say, ‘Well, it stimulates the economy but it passes on a burden.’ You

* \*This is typically accomplished by using two or more cameras and switching from one camera to another.

* †There are about eleven minutes of commercials per hour, the exact time varying by network and program. Thus, at a rate of  4 per minute, the total number of commercials per hour is 44. This calculates, therefore, to 78 shifts outside commercials plus  748 shifts \(17 shifts per commercial  44 commercials per hour\) within commercials for a total of 826.

one because it will get you noticed.”\)



Print journalism is also in the grip of sensationalism. As a newspaper editor observed, “Journalists keep trying to find people  who are at 1 or at 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 rather than people at 3 to 7 \[the more moderate positions\] where most people actually are.”13 Another journalist claims, “News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact. Journalists are slipping into  entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we need to know.”14



Today’s politicians often manipulate people more offensively than do journalists. Instead of expressing their thoughts, some  oliticians find out what people think and pretend to share their ideas. Many politicians hire people to conduct polls and focus  groups to learn what messages will “sell.” They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words—that is why we hear so  much about “trust,” “family,” “character,” and “values” these days. Political science professor Larry Sabato says that during the  Clinton impeachment trial, the president’s advisors used the term private lives over and over—James Carville used it six times  in one four-minute speech—because they knew it could persuade people into believing the president’s lying under oath was of  no great consequence.15
