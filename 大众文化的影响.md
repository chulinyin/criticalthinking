> In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes the only, influence on children. Today, however, the  influence exerted by mass culture \(the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and popular music\) often is greater.

在过去的几个世纪里，家庭和老师对孩子的影响是占主导地位的，，并且有时候是唯一的。然而，今天大众文化（广播媒体、报纸、杂志、互联网、流行音乐）产生的影响往往更强大。

> By age 18 the average teenager has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom and 22,000 hours in front of the television set. He or  she has had perhaps 13,000 school lessons yet has watched more than 750,000 commercials. By age thirty-five the same  person has had fewer than 20,000 school lessons yet has watched approximately 45,000 hours of television and close to 2 million commercials.

到18 岁的时候，一般的青少年已经花费了 11,000 小时在教室中， 22,000 小时在电视机前。他或她或许已经上了 13,000 门学校课程，但已经看了超过 750,000 个广告。到了 35 岁的时候，同样一个人已经上了不到 20,000 门学校课程，但已经看了大约 45,000 小时的电视和接近 200 万个广告。

> What effects does mass culture have on us? To answer, we need only consider the formats and devices commonly used in the  media. Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebrities. This approach is  designed to appeal to emotions and create artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people develop the  habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to such appeals. They also tend to acquire values very different from  those taught in the home and the school. Ads often portray play as more fulfilling than work, self-gratification as more desirable  than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.

大众文化对我们有什么影响？为了回答，我们只需要考虑在媒体中常用的格式和设备。现代广告通常用名人的口号和赞扬轰击大众。这种方法旨在吸引情感，并创造对产品和服务的人为需要。因此，许多人养成了对这种吸引情绪化地、冲动地、轻信地回应的习惯。他们也倾向于获得与家庭和学校教育的价值观非常不同的价值观。广告通常将游戏描绘得比工作更让人满足，自我满足比自我控制更值得拥有，物质主义比理想主义更有意义。

> Television programmers use frequent scene shifts and sensory appeals such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters  to keep audience interest from diminishing. Then they add frequent commercial interruptions. This author has analyzed the  attention shifts that television viewers are subjected to. In a dramatic program, for example, attention shifts might include  camera angle changes;\* shifts in story line from one set of characters \(or subplot\) to another, or from a present scene to a   past scene \(flashback\), or to fantasy; and shifts to “newsbreaks,” to commercial breaks, from one commercial to another, and  back to the program. Also included might be shifts of attention that occur within commercials. I found as many as 78 shifts per  hour, excluding the shifts within commercials. The number of shifts within commercials ranged from 6 to 54 and averaged  approximately 17 per fifteen-second commercial. The total number of attention shifts came out to over 800 per hour, or over 14 per minute.†

电视节目人员使用频繁的场景转换和感官吸引，如车祸、暴力、性接触，以防止观众减少兴趣。接着他们添加频繁的广告中断。本作者分析了电视观众受到的注意力转移。在一个戏剧性的节目中，例如，注意力转移可能包括镜头角度变化；故事线从一组人物（或者情节）移到另一组， 或者从当前的场景移到过去的场景（倒叙）或者到幻想；并且移到新闻广告、移到商业广告，从一个广告移到另一个，回到节目。也包括可能是在广告内发生的注意转移。我发现每小时不下于 78 次移动，不包括广告中的移动。在广告中的移动次数范围从 6 到 54 ，每 15 秒广告平均大约 17 次。注意力转移的总次数每小时超过 800 次，或者每分钟超过 14 次。

This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the  workplace to provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and  when it isn’t met they call their teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to  read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.

Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published authors, they are often directed to give short, dramatic  answers during promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. A man who coaches writers for talk shows  offered one client this advice: “If I ask you whether the budget deficit is a good thing or a bad thing, you should not say, ‘Well, it stimulates the economy but it passes on a burden.’ You

* \*This is typically accomplished by using two or more cameras and switching from one camera to another.

* †There are about eleven minutes of commercials per hour, the exact time varying by network and program. Thus, at a rate of  4 per minute, the total number of commercials per hour is 44. This calculates, therefore, to 78 shifts outside commercials plus  748 shifts \(17 shifts per commercial  44 commercials per hour\) within commercials for a total of 826.


have to say ‘It’s a great idea!’ or ‘It’s a terrible idea!’ It doesn’t matter which.”12 \(Translation: ”Don’t give a balanced answer. Give an oversimplified one because it will get you noticed.”\)

Print journalism is also in the grip of sensationalism. As a newspaper editor observed, “Journalists keep trying to find people  who are at 1 or at 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 rather than people at 3 to 7 \[the more moderate positions\] where most people actually are.”13 Another journalist claims, “News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact. Journalists are slipping into  entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we need to know.”14

Today’s politicians often manipulate people more offensively than do journalists. Instead of expressing their thoughts, some  oliticians find out what people think and pretend to share their ideas. Many politicians hire people to conduct polls and focus  groups to learn what messages will “sell.” They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words—that is why we hear so  much about “trust,” “family,” “character,” and “values” these days. Political science professor Larry Sabato says that during the  Clinton impeachment trial, the president’s advisors used the term private lives over and over—James Carville used it six times  in one four-minute speech—because they knew it could persuade people into believing the president’s lying under oath was of  no great consequence.15
