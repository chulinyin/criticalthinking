> The basic activities in critical thinking are investigation, interpretation, and judgment, in that order. The following chart summarizes each activ ity in relation to the other two.

理性思维的基本活动的顺序是调查研究、理解、判断。下表格总结了每个活动与另外两个的关系。

| **Activity** | **Definition** | **Requirements** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investigation | Finding evidence—that is,data that will answer key questions about the issue | The evidence must be both relevant and sufficient. |
| Interpretation | Deciding what the evidence means | The interpretation must be more reasonable than competing interpretations. |
| Judgment | Reaching a conclusion about the issue | The conclusion must meet the test of logic. |

| **活动** | **定义** | **要求** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| 调查研究 | 寻找证据——即，回答关于该问题的关键问题的数据。 | 证据必须有关并有效的。 |
| 理解 | 确定证据意味着什么 | 理解必须比与之竞争的理解更合理。 |
| 判断 | 关于问题得出一个结论 | 结论必须经过逻辑测试。 |

> As we noted previously, irresponsible thinkers first choose their con- clusions and then seek out evidence to justify their choices. They fail to realize that the only conclusion worth drawing is one based on a thorough understanding of the problem or issue and its possible solutions or resolutions. Is it acceptable to speculate, guess, and form hunches and hypotheses? Absolutely. Such activities provide a helpful starting point for the thinking process. \(Besides, we couldn’t avoid doing so even if we tried.\) The crucial thing is not to let hunches and hypotheses manipulate our thinking and dictate our conclusion in advance.

正如我们之前所提到的，不负责任的思考者首先选择他们的结论，然后寻找证据来证明他们的选择。他们没有认识到，唯一值得借鉴的结论是基于对问题或者困难及其可能的解决办法或决议的透彻理解。假设、猜测并形成直觉和假设是可接受的吗？当然。这些活动为思考过程提供了一个有益的起点。（而且，即使我们尝试，我们也不能避免这样做。）最重要的是不要让直觉和假设操控我们的思维，提前决定我们的结论。
