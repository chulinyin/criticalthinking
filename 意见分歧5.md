> The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After reading the statement, use the library and/or the Internet and find what knowl- edgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you reached that conclusion. If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, constructa view of your own that combines the insights from all views and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or an oral report, as your instructor specifies.

下面一段文章总结了一个重要的不同意见。在阅读该陈述之后，使用图书馆和互联网，寻找知识渊博的人关于这个问题说了什么。确保覆盖了整个范围的观点。然后评价每个观点的优缺点。如果你推断一个观点是完全正确的，而其他观点是错误的，解释你是如何得到这个结论的。更可能的情况是，你发现一个观点比其它观点更富有洞察力，但是它们都有一些正确的点，则结合所有观点的见解，g构造一个你自己的观点，并解释为什么这个观点是所有观点中最合理的。按照你老师的指定，在一个书面或者口头报告中展示你的回答。

> Is the threat of global warming real or imaginary? As recently as the 1970s, many scientists were warning of the dangers, not of global warming, but of global cooling. Nevertheless, the most widely publicized alarms today con- cern global warming. For example, Bob Corell, Senior Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, notes that the earth’s glaciers are receding at an alarming rate and that the ice field surrounding the North Pole has already shrunk dramatically. In all, approximately 105 million acres of ice have melted in the past fifteen years alone. The cause of this change, he believes, is the carbon dioxide created by human activity, notably through the burning of fossil fuels. The result, he predicts, will be a rise in sea level of 3 feet over the next 100 years and the inundation of low-lying coastal areas in every country on earth.25

全球变暖的威胁是真的还是虚构的？就在19世纪80年代，许多科学家还警告全球变冷的危险。尽管如此，今天最广泛宣传的警报都与全球变暖有关。例如，美国气象学会高级研究员 Bob Corell 注意到地球的冰川正在以惊人的速度减少，北极周围的冰原已经急剧萎缩。总而言之，在过去十五年间，大约有1.05亿英亩的冰融化了。他认为这种变化的原因是人类活动产生的二氧化碳，尤其是通过燃烧化石燃料所产生的。他预言，在未来百年内，海平面将上升3英尺，地球上每个国家的低洼沿海地区将被淹没。

But not all scientists agree. For example, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology \(MIT\), maintains that claims of global warming are “junk science” that is being hyped by people with a “vested interest in alarm.” Lindzen argues that even when the data published by such people are accurate, they do not support the conclusions drawn and the dire predictions made. Moreover, he claims that experts who dare to challenge the official view of global warming are being intimidated into silence, notably by threats that their research funding will be cut off and their publications suppressed. In support of this claim, he cites his own experience and that of scientists in several other countries.26 \(Compounding the difficulty of this issue is the fact that in 2009 it was learned that some prominent scientists, in email exchanges, seemed to be condoning the manipulation of research data to support the global warming thesis.\)

但并不是所有科学家都同意。例如，麻省理工学院的大气科学教授 Richard Lindzen 坚称，全球变暖的主张是“垃圾科学”，正在被从警告中获得利益的人夸张地宣传。Lindzen 认为即使被这些人公布的数据是准确的，它们也不支撑所得出的结论以及可怕的预言。此外，他宣称，敢于挑战全球变暖的官方看法的专家正在被迫沉默，尤其通过威胁他们的研究资金将被中断，他们的出版物将被查禁。为了支持这一说法，他引用了他自身和其他几个国家的科学家的经历。（加剧这一问题的困难是，在2009年了解到的事实：一些著名的科学家在电子邮件交流中，似乎正在容忍篡改研究数据以支持全球变暖的论点。）
