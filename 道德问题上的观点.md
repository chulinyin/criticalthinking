> The notion that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion is especially strong in the area of morality. Questions of right and wrong are presumed to be completely subjective and personal. According to this notion, if you believe a particular behavior is immoral and I believe it is moral, even noble, we are both right. Your view is “right for you” and mine is “right for me.”

每个人都有权获得他/她的观点的观念在道德领域尤其强烈。对与错的问题被假定为完全主观和个人的。按照这个观念，如果你相信某个行为是不道德的，而我认为它是道德，甚至高尚的，我们都是对的。你的观点对你而言是对的，而我的（观点）对我而言是对的。

> This popular perspective may seem eminently sensible and broad-minded, but it is utterly shallow. Almost every day, situations arise that require reasonable people to violate it. Have you ever heard anyone claim that burglary, spousal abuse, or rape is morally acceptable for those who believe it is? When someone is convicted of child molesting, do citizens parade in front of the courthouse with banners proclaiming “Pedophilia may be wrong for us, but it was right for him”? If your instructor discovers you cheating on an examination, will she accept your explanation that you believe the end justifies the means? If a Breathalyzer test reveals that your classmate was driving with a blood alcohol level higher than his grade point average, will the police officer commend him for living by his moral conviction?

这个流行观点看起来似乎十分明智并且心胸开阔，然而它是非常肤浅的。几乎每天都会出现需要合理的人来违反它的情况。你是否曾听人宣称入室盗窃、家庭暴力或者强奸对于那些相信它是道德的人来说在道德上是可接受的？当有人被判处儿童骚扰罪时，公民有带着宣称“恋童癖可能对我们是错的，但对他是正确的”的横幅在法院大楼前游行吗？如果你的老师发现你在一次考试中作弊，她会接受你认为的只要目的正当可以不择手段的解释吗？如果酒精测试仪测试出你的同学酒驾，警察会称赞他以自己的道德信念生存吗？

> Virtually every professional organization and every corporation has a code of ethics that specifies the behaviors that are required or forbidden. Every country has a body of laws with prescribed penalties for violators. There are even international laws that govern affairs among countries. All these codes and legal systems don’t appear out of thin air. They are the products of moral judgment, the same mental activity individuals use in deciding everyday issues of right and wrong. And they are subject to the same limitations and imperfections. Opinions about moral issues, like other opinions, may be correct or incorrect.

几乎每个专业组织和公司都有道德规范，规定了要求或禁止的行为。每个国家有一套为违反者规定了处罚的法律。 甚至有国际法管理国家间的事务。所有的这些准则和法律系统都不是凭空出现的。 它们是道德判断的产物，个体用相同的精神活动判断日常问题的对错。并且他们可能受到同样的限制和缺陷。对于道德问题的观点，像其他观点一样，可能是对的或者错的。

> Are there criteria we can use to increase the chance that our moral judgments will be correct? Definitely. The most important criteria are obligations, ideals, and consequences.\*

有我们可以用于增加我们道德判断正确性的标准吗？当然。最重要的标准是义务、理想和后果。

* > Obligations: Obligations are restrictions on behavior,demands that we do or avoid doing something. The most obvious kinds of obligations are formal agreements such as contracts. Others include professional and business obligations, and obligations of friendship and citizenship. When two or more obligations conflict, the most important one should take precedence.•

  义务：义务是对行为的限制，要求我们做或者避免做某事。最明显的义务类型是正式协议，如合同。其他包括专业和商业义务，以及友谊和公民义务。当两个或者多个义务冲突时，应该优先考虑最重要的那个。

* > Ideals: In the general sense, ideals are notions of excellence, goals that bring greater harmony within ourselves and with others. In ethics they are also specific concepts that help us maintain respect for persons. Some noteworthy examples of ideals are honesty, integrity, justice, and fairness. When two or more ideals conflict in a given situation, the most important one should be given precedence.

  理想：在一般意义上，理想是卓越的概念，是在我们自己和其他人之间带来更大和谐的目标。在伦理学中，它们还是具体的概念，帮助我们维持对他人的尊重。理想的一些情况中冲突时，应该优先考虑最重要的那个。

* > Consequences: Consequences are the beneficial and/or harmful results of an action that affect both the person performing that action and other people. Any examination of consequences should consider the various kinds: personal and societal; physical and emotional; immediate and eventual; intended and unintended; obvious and subtle; and possible, probable, and certain. Actions that achieve beneficial consequences should be preferred over those that do harm.

  后果：后果是指一个行为的有益或者有害结果，该行为同时影响执行者和他人。任何对后果的考察都应该各种情况：个人的和社会的；身体的和情感的；立即的和最终的；有意的和无意的；明显的和细微的；以及可能、很有可能和确定的。实现有益后果的行为应该优先于产生有害后果的行为。

  Whenever the consequences are mixed \(some beneficial, others harmful\), the preferred action is the one that achieves the greater good or the lesser evil.

  每当后果混杂时（一些有益的，其他有害的），优先选择的行为是实现更大好处或更小坏处的行为。
