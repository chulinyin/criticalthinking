> Intuition is commonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension of something—that is, sensing or understanding something without the use of reasoning. Some everyday experiences seem to support this definition. You may have met a stranger and instantly “known”that you would be partners for life. When a car salesman told you that the price he was quoting you was his final, rock-bottom price,your intuition may have told you he was lying. On the first day of a particular course, you may have had a strong sense that you would not do well in it.

直觉通常定义为对事物的直接感觉或理解——即，感觉或理解一些东西而不使用推理。一些日常经历似乎支持这个定义。你可能遇到一个陌生人，并立即“知道” 他\/她 将是你终身的伴侣。当一个汽车销售告诉你，他报给你的价格是他的最低价了，你的直觉可能告诉你他正在说谎。在一个特别的课程的第一天，你可能已经有一种强烈的感觉，你不会在课程中做的很好。

> Some important discoveries seem to have occurred instantaneously. For example, the German chemist Kekule found the solution to a difficult chemical problem intuitively. He was very tired when he slipped into a daydream. The image of a snake swallowing its tail came to him—and that provided the clue to the structure of the benzene molecule, which is a ring, rather than a chain, of atoms.9 The German writer Goethe had been experiencing great difficulty organizing a large mass of material for one of his works when he learned of the tragic suicide of a closefriend. At that very instant, the plan for organizing his material occurred to him in detail.10 The English writer Samuel Taylor Coleridge \(you may have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner in high school\) awoke from a dream with 200–300 lines of a new and complex poem clearly in mind.

一些重要的发现似乎出现在一瞬间。例如，德国化学家 Kekule 凭直觉发现了解决一个困难化学问题的办法。当他陷入白日梦时，他非常疲劳。一条吞噬自己尾巴的蛇当图像来到了他的梦中，这提供了苯分子结构的线索，苯分子是一个原子环而不是一条原子链。 德国作家 Goethe， 当他得知一位密友的自杀时，他正在为组织他一个作品的大量素材经历很大的困难。在那个瞬间，组织材料的详细方案被他想到了。英国作家 Samuel Taylor Coleridge （你可能在高中读过他的《古舟子咏》）从一个梦中清醒，并在脑中带着一首 200-300 行的新的并且复杂的诗。

> Such examples seem to suggest that intuition is very different from reasoning and is not influenced by it. But before accepting that conclu-sion, consider these facts:

这种例子似乎暗示直觉时非常不同于推理的，并且不会被其影响。但是在接受这个结论之前，考虑这些事实：

* > Breakthrough ideas favor trained, active minds. It is unusual for someone totally untrained in a subject to make a significant new dis-covery about it. Thus, if Kekule had been a plumber, Goethe a book-keeper, and Coleridge a hairdresser, they would almost certainly not have received the intuitions for which they are famous.
  > 
  > Some intuitions eventually prove to be mistaken. That attractive stranger may turn out to be not your lifelong partner but a person for whom you develop a strong dislike. The car salesman’s finalprice may have proved to be exactly that. And instead of doing poorly in that course, you may have done well.
  > 
  > It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the quality of our intu-itions because we tend to forget the ones that prove mistaken in much the same way a gambler forgets his losses.

  突破性想法偏袒受过训练的、积极的头脑。对于一个完全未在一个科目中受过训练的人来说，对该科目做出了一个重要的新发现，是不寻常的。因此，如果 Kekule 是一个管子工， Goethe 是一个图书管理员， Coleridge 是一个美发师，他们几乎肯定不会得到他们著名的直觉。

  有些直觉最终证明是错误的。那个有吸引力的陌生人可能不是你的终生伴侣而是一个你会对之产生强烈厌恶的人。汽车销售的最终价格可能证明确实是那样的。在那门课程中，你可能做得很好而不是很差。

  很难对我们直觉的质量做一个总体的评价，因为我们倾向于忘记那些被证明是错误的直觉，就像赌徒忘记他的损失一样。


> These facts have led some scholars to conclude that intuition is simply a consequence of thinking. They would say that something about the stranger appealed to you, something the salesman said or did suggested insincerity, something about the professor frightened you. In each case,they would explain, you made a quick decision—so quick, in fact, that you were unaware that you’d been thinking. In the case of the breakthrough ideas, the scholars would say that when people become engrossed in problems or issues, their unconscious minds often continue working on them long after they have turned their attention elsewhere.Thus, when an insight seems to come “out of nowhere,” it is actually a delayed result of thinking.

这些事实使得一些学者推断直觉仅仅是思考的结果。他们会说陌生人的一些东西吸引了你，销售员说的或者做的暗示着虚伪，教授使你惊恐。在每种情况中，他们会解释，你做了一个快速的决定——实际上如此之快，以至于你没有意识到你在一直思考。在突破性想法的情况中，学者会说当人们专注于困难或者问题，在他们已经转移注意力到别处后，他们的无意识精神往往继续工作。因此，当一个见解似乎莫名其妙地出现，这实际上是一个延迟的思考结果 。

> Which view of intuitions is the correct one? Are intuitions different from and independent of thinking or not? Perhaps, for now, the most prudent answer is that sometimes they are independent and sometimes theyare not; we can’t be sure when they are, and therefore it is imprudent to rely on them.

对直觉的观点哪个是正确的？直觉是否与思考不同并且独立于思考？或许，现在，最谨慎的回答是：有时候它们是独立的，有时候不是；我们不能确定它们什么时候是独立的，因此依赖它们是不明智的。
