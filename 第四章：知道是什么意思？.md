> Sally looks up from her composition and asks her roommates, “How do you spell embarrass?”

Sally 从她的位置向上看，然后问她的室友，“embarrass 怎么拼？”

> Nancy says, “I’m not sure. I think it has a double r and a double s. Oh,I really don’t know.”

Nacy 说，“我不确定。我想它有两个r 和两个 s。噢，我真的不知道。”

> Marie smiles her smug smile. “I guess spelling isn’t your cup of tea,Nancy. The correct spelling is e-m-b-a-r-a-s-s. Only one r.”

Marie 露出得意的微笑。“Nancy，我猜拼写不是你的菜。正确的拼写是 e-m-b-a-r-a-s-s 。只有一个 r 。”

> By this time Sally has already opened her dictionary. “Might as well check to be sure,” she says. “Let’s see, embargo, embark . . . here it is,embarrass. Double r and double s. You were right, Nancy.”

此时 Sallly 已经打开了她的字典。“不如检查确定一下，”她说。“让我们看看，embargo, embark … 找到了，embarrass。两个 r 和 两个 s 。你是对的，Nacny。”

> Let’s consider what happened more closely. Marie knew the answer,but she was wrong. Nancy didn’t know, but she was right. Confusing. What kind of thing can this knowing be? When you’re doing it, you’re not doing it. And when you aren’t, you are.

让我们更仔细地考虑发生了什么。Marie 知道答案，但是她是错的。Nancy 不知道，但是她是对的。令人困惑。这种认知是一种什么样的东西呢？当你正在做时，你没在做。当你不是时，你是。

> Fortunately, it only appears to be that way. The confusion arises because the feelings that accompany knowing can be present when we don’t know. Marie had those feelings. She no longer wondered or experienced any confusion; she was sure of the answer. Yet she was mistaken.

幸运的是，它似乎只是这样。困惑的出现是因为当我们不知道的时候，伴随着知道的感觉会出现。Marie有了这些感觉。她不再怀疑或经历任何困惑；她肯定那个答案。然而她错了。
