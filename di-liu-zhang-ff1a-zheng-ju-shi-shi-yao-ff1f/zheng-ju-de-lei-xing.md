> To evaluate your own and other people’s opinions, you will need to understand the various kinds of evidence. This entails knowing the value and limitations of each kind, as well as the appropriate questions to ask.The most important kinds of evidence are personal experience, unpublished report, published report, eyewitness testimony, celebrity testimony, expert opinion, experiment, statistics, survey, formal observation, and research review.

为了评估自己和他人的观点，你需要了解各种类型的证据。这意味着要知道每种证据的价值和局限，以及要提出的问题。最重要的证据类型是个人经验、未发表和已发表的报告、目击证人的证词、名人的证词、 专家的意见、实验、统计、调查、正式的观察以及研究综述。

> It is important to note that the arrangement here is not in ascending or descending order of reliability but rather in rough order of familiarity—with personal experience being very familiar to most people and research review much less familiar.i

值得注意的是，这里的证据类型并不是以可靠性顺序而是以大致熟悉程度排列——比如，个人经验对大多数人而言非常熟悉，研究综述则不太熟悉。

#### PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

#### 个人经验

> Personal experience is the one kind of evidence we don’t have to go to the library or the Internet to get. We carry it with us in our minds. For this reason, it tends to exert a greater influence than other kinds of evidence. The individuals we’ve met, the situations we’ve been in, and the things that have happened to us seem more authentic and meaningful than what we have merely heard or read. We are confident about our personal experi-ence. Unfortunately, this confidence can cause us to attach greater significance and universality to particular events than they deserve. If we ride in a New York City taxicab on one occasion, we may think we are acquainted with New York City taxicab drivers. If we have a Korean friend, we may feel that we know Koreans in general or even Asians in general. However,it takes more than one or a few examples to support a generalization; for sweeping generalizations, even a dozen may not be enough.

个人经验是一种我们不必去图书馆或互联网获得的证据，它就在我们的脑中。因此，它往往比其他类型的证据有更大的影响力。我们遇到过的人和的情况，以及在我们身上发生过的事情似乎比我们刚刚听过或读到的东西更加真实和有意义。我们对我们的个人经验充满信心。然而不幸的是，这种信心会使我们对特殊事件附加更多的重要性和普遍性。如果我们曾经乘坐过纽约的出租车，我们或许会认为我们了解纽约的出租车司机。如果我们有一个韩国的朋友，我们可能会觉得我们大体上了解了韩国人甚至亚洲人。然而，证明一个泛化（概括），需要超过一个或多个例子；为了彻底的泛化，甚至十几个可能还不够。

> To evaluate personal experience—your own or other people’s—ask, Are the events typical or unique? Are they sufficient in number and kind to support the conclusion? Remember that the vividness and dramatic quality of an anecdote cannot compensate for its limitedness.

为了评估你自己或者其他人的个人经验—学会问自己，事件是典型的还是独特的？数量和种类是否足够支持结论？记住，一件轶事的生动和戏剧性质量无法弥补其有限性。

#### UNPUBLISHED REPORT

#### 未发表的报告

> Unpublished reports are stories we hear from other people, often referred to as gossip or hearsay. The biggest problem with such reports is that it is difficult to confirm them. In many cases, we don’t know whether the stories are secondhand or third-, fourth-, or fiftiethhand. And stories have away of changing as they are passed from person to person. The people who repeat them may not be dishonest; they may, in fact, try to be accurate but then inadvertently leave out some words, add others, or change the details or the order of events.

未发表的报告是指我们从其他人那里听来的故事，通常被称为八卦或传闻。这种报告最大的问题是难以证实。在许多情况下，我们不知道故事是二手，三手，还是四手，甚至五手的？而且当故事在人与人之间传递时就已经变了。那些重复它们的人可能是不诚实的；事实上，他们可能试图变得准确，但却在无意间漏掉了几个词，加了其他的词或者改变了细节或事件顺序。

To evaluate an unpublished report, ask, Where did the story originate? How can I confirm that the version I heard is accurate?

为了评估未发表的报告，学会问自己，故事起源于哪里？如何确认我听到的版本是准确的？

#### PUBLISHED REPORT

#### 已发表的报告

> This kind of evidence is found in a wide variety of published or broadcast works, from scholarly books, professional journals, and encyclopedia articles to magazine or newspaper articles, news broadcasts, and radio or television commentaries. In scholarly works the sources of the material usually are carefully documented in footnotes and bibliographic citations. In nonscholarly works, the documentation may be informal, fragmentary,or, in some cases, nonexistent. Even when the source is not cited, we can assess the author’s and publisher’s reliability. Facts and opinions are often mingled in contemporary publications, particularly nonscholarly ones, so careful reading may be necessary to reveal which statements constitute evidence and which statements should be supported with evidence.

这种证据存在于从学术著作、专业期刊以及百科全书到杂志或报纸文章、新闻广播和电台或者电视评论等各种出版或广播作品中。在学术作品中，材料的来源通常被仔细记录在脚注和文献引用中。在非学术工作中，文档可能是非正式的、不完整的或者在某些情况下是不存在的。即使没有引用来源，我们也可以评估作者和出版商的可靠性。事实和观点往往被混合在现代出版物中，尤其是非学术出版物，因此仔细阅读可能是必要的，以揭示哪些陈述构成证据，而哪些陈述应该用证据支撑。

> To evaluate a published report, ask, Does the report cite the sources of all important items of information? \(If so, you may wish to check them.\)Does the author have a reputation for careful reporting? Does the pub-lisher or broadcaster have a reputation for reliability? Which statements in the published report constitute evidence, and which should themselves be supported with evidence? \(Another way to ask this question is Which statements might a thoughtful person challenge? Does the author anticipate and answer the challenges satisfactorily?\)

为了评估已发表的报告，学会问自己，报告是否引用了所有重要信息项的来源？（如果引用了，你可能希望检查它们。）作者是否有仔细报告的声誉？出版社或者广播机构是否有可靠性的声誉？已发表报告中的哪些陈述构成了证据，哪些需要用证据支持？（提这个问题的另一种方式是哪些陈述可能是一个深思熟虑的人会挑战的？作者是否有预料到，并令人满意地回应挑战？）

#### EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY

#### 目击证人的证词

> Because eyewitness testimony is commonly considered to be the most reli-able kind of evidence, you may be surprised to find that it is sometimes badly flawed for any one of several reasons. The external conditions may not have been optimal—for example, the incident may have occurred late on a foggy night and the eyewitness may have been some distance away. The eyewitness may have been tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs; his or her observation may also have been distorted by preconceptions or expectations. Further, the person’s memory of what occurred may have been confused by subsequent events. Such confusion can be a special problem when considerable time has elapsed between the event and the testimony.

由于目击证人的证词通常被认为是最可靠的证据，所以你可能会惊讶的发现它有时会由于某些原因而有严重缺陷。外部环境可能不是最理想的——例如，事故可能发生在一个雾气弥漫的夜晚，而目击者距离现场有点距离。目击者可能已经非常疲惫或者被酒精、毒品所影响。他/她的观察还可能被偏见或期望扭曲。此外，对于所发生事情的个人记忆可能会被后续的事情混淆。当考虑到事件和证词之间经过的时间，这种混淆可能会是一个特殊的问题，。

> To evaluate eyewitness testimony, ask, What circumstances surrounding the event, including the eyewitness’s state of mind, could have distorted his or her perception? \(If any such distortion was likely, try to determine whether it actually occurred.\) What circumstances since the event—for example, the publication of other accounts of the event—could have affected the eyewitness’s recollection?

为了评估目击证人的证词，学会问自己，事故周围的什么环境，包括目击者的精神状态，可能会扭曲他/她的感知？（如果有任何这种扭曲的可能，尝试确定是否真的发生了这种情况。）事故发生后的什么环境——如，发布其他事件——可能会影响目击者的记忆？

#### CELEBRITY TESTIMONY

#### 名人的证词

> Increasingly, celebrities are seen endorsing products and services in commercials and infomercials. In addition, when they appear as guests on radio and television talk shows, they are encouraged to state their personal views about whatever happens to be in the news at the time. On any given day you may hear singers, actors, and athletes discussing reli-gion, criminal justice, education, economics, international relations, campaign finance reform, and psychology, among other topics. For example,a TV host once asked an actor, “How big a factor in human life do you believe is chance in the universe?”

越来越多的名人代言商业广告和电子商务中的产品和服务。此外，当他们作为嘉宾在广播和电视脱口秀上出现时，他们被鼓励对时事新闻发表个人看法。在每一天你都可能听到歌手、演员和运动员讨论宗教、刑事审判、教育、经济、国际关系、竞选财政制度改革和心理学等话题。例如，电视主持人曾问过一名演员，“你认为人类生活中有多大的因素是宇宙的机会？”

> Your respect for celebrities as entertainers may lead you to assume that they know what they are talking about in interviews. This assump-tion is often mistaken. They may be very well informed. Or they may have been caught unawares by the host’s question and, not wanting to seem ignorant, uttered whatever happened to come to mind. Some celebrities may be so impressed with their own importance that they imagine whatever they say is profound for no other reason than that they say it! In the case of testimonials for products or services, the celebritiesmay have been paid to say things about products that they know little or nothing about.

你把名人当做艺人一样尊重可能会导致你假定他们知道他们在采访中谈论的东西。这种假设通常是错误的。他们可能是非常见多识广的。或者他们可能被主持人的问题问住了，但又不想显得无知，于是就想到什么说什么。一些名人可能深深地为他们自己的重要性所折服以至于他们认为他们说什么都是都是深刻的，没有别的原因。至于代言产品或服务，名人收取酬劳，然后说一些他们知之甚少的产品的事情。

> To evaluate celebrity testimony, ask, In the case of advertisements or infomercials, is the celebrity a paid spokes person? \(This is often indicated in small print at the end of the ad.\) In the case of talk show comments,does the celebrity offer any support for his or her views—for example,citing research conducted by qualified people? Also, does the host ask for such support? If the discussion consists of little more than a series of assertions expressing the celebrity’s unsupported opinion, you would do well to discount it no matter now much you may admire the person.

为了评估名人的证词，学会问自己，在宣传片和商业广告中，名人是一个收费说话的人吗？（广告末尾通常会以小字指出。）在脱口秀评论中，名人有为他/她的看法提供任何依据吗——例如，引用合格人士进行的研究？另外，主持人是否要求这样的依据？如果讨论是由一系列断言来表达名人的没有依据的观点，你最好忽视它，无论你有多欣赏那个人。

#### EXPERT OPINION

#### 专家意见

> As you might expect, expert opinion is generally more reliable than mostof the varieties of evidence we have considered so far. The advantage it enjoys over personal experience is that it can usually address the crucial question of what is typical and what is not. Nevertheless, not even expert opinion is consistently reliable. The most significant reason for unreliability is that knowledge in virtually every field is rapidly expanding. A century ago it was possible to gain expertise in more than one discipline. Today’s scholars typically have expertise in a single narrow aspect of one discipline and may have difficulty keeping abreast of significant developments in that one. Unfortunately, some people can’t resist the temptation to think of themselves as experts in everything. A well-known astronomer,for example, used to write articles in popular magazines and offer hisopinions on ethics, anthropology, and theology.

正如你所期望的那样， 专家意见通常比我们之前考虑的大多数证据更可靠。它享有的个人经验之上的优势是它通常可以解决什么是典型的和什么不是的关键问题。尽管如此，甚至专家的意见也不是始终可靠的。不可靠的最重要原因是几乎每个领域的知识都正在迅速扩大。一个世纪以前，获得多个学科的专业知识是可能的。但今天的学者们通常只具有一门学科的某个狭窄方面的专业知识，并且可能难以跟上那个学科的重大发展。不幸的是，一些人无法抵抗认为他们自己在所有事情上都是专家的诱惑。例如，一位著名的天文学家曾在流行杂志上写文章，提供了他对伦理学、人类学和神学的观点。

> To evaluate expert opinion, ask, Does the person have, in addition to credentials in the broad field in question, specific expertise in the particular issue under discussion? This is not always easy to ascertain by those outside the field, but one good indication is that the person does not just state his or her opinion but also supports it with references to currentresearch. Also ask whether the expert was paid. The acceptance of money does not necessarily taint expert opinion, but it may raise questions about the person’s objectivity. Finally, ask whether other authorities agree or disagree with the expert’s view.

为了评估专家意见，学会问自己，除了有关广泛领域的凭证，在特定问题的讨论下，这人还有具体的专业知识吗？通过这些外在的领域这并不总是容易确定，但是一个好的迹象是，那个人不仅陈述他/她自己的观点，还引用当年前的研究支持它。还要学会问自己，专家是否有酬劳。接受金钱不一定污染专家意见，但是这可能会引起人们对客观性的质疑。最后，学会问自己，是否有其他专家同意或不同这个专家的意见。

#### EXPERIMENT

#### 实验

> There are two broad types of experiments. The laboratory experiment enables researchers to vary the conditions and thereby identify causes and effects more precisely. One disadvantage of the laboratory experiment, however,is its artificiality. The field experiment has the advantage of occurring in anatural setting, but the presence of the researchers can influence the subjects and distort the findings.

有两种广泛的实验。实验室实验让研究者可以改变条件，从而更精确地识别出原因和影响。然而，实验室实验的一个缺点是它的人为性。现场实验具有在自然环境中发生的优点，但是研究者的存在会影响研究对象并扭曲结果。

> To evaluate experimental evidence, ask, For a laboratory experiment, has it been replicated by other researchers? For a field experiment, have other researchers independently confirmed the findings? If replication or confirmation has been unsuccessfully attempted, it is best to postpone your acceptance of the experiment’s findings.

为了评估实验的证据，学会问自己，对于实验室实验，它是否曾被其他研究者重现？对于现场实验，还有其他研究者独立确认过该发现吗？如果重现和确认未遂，你最好推迟接受实验室发现。

#### STATISTICS

#### 统计

> In the broad sense, the term statistics applies to any information that can be quantified, for example, the changes in average temperature over a period of time to determine whether the phenomenon of global warming is occurring. The term statistics may also be used more narrowly to mean quantifiable information about a group that is obtained by contacting, or otherwise accounting for, every individual in the group. The U.S. Census is one example of statistics in this sense. Others are the voting records of U.S. senators,the percentage of automobile fatalities involving drunk driving, the fluctuations in immigration patterns over the past century, the percentage of unwed mothers who come from one-parent homes, and the comparative education and income levels of various racial-ethnic groups.

从广义上来说，术语“统计”适用于可以被量化的任何信息，例如，通过在一段时期的平均温度变化，确定全球变暖现象是否正在发生。术语“统计”也可以更狭义地使用，量化通过联系获得的一个团队的信息，或者计算团队中的每个人。在这个意义上，美国人口普查是一个统计的例子。其它的是美国参议员的投票记录，汽车事故中涉及酒后驾车的百分比，在过去一个世纪移民格局的波动，来自单亲家庭的未婚妈妈的比例，比较各种种族的教育以及收入水平。

> As Joel Best notes, although “we think of statistics as facts that we discover, not as numbers we create . . . , statistics do not exist independently” but are summaries of complex information. Sometimes statistical errors are intentional, he explains, but more often “they are the result ofconfusion, incompetence, innumeracy, or selective, self-righteous efforts to produce numbers that reaffirm principles and interests that their advocates consider just and right.” Best recommends asking three questions when evaluating any statistic: “Who created it? For what purpose was itcreated? How was it created?”

Joel Best 指出，尽管“我们认为统计数据是我们发现的事实，而不是我们创造的数字…，统计不会独立存在”，而是复杂信息的总结。他解释说，有时候统计误差是故意的， 但更常见的是“它们是混淆、无能、数学盲，或者选择性的，自以为是的努力，产生重申其倡导者认为公平公正的原则和利益的数字”。因此，评估任何统计的时候建议问三个问题：“谁创造了它？创造它的目的是什么？它是如何被创造的？”

> When evaluating statistical information, ask, as well, What is the source of the statistics? Is the source reliable? How old are the data? Have any important factors changed since the data were collected?

在评估统计资料的时候，还要学会问自己，统计来源是什么？来源可靠吗？数据是多久前的？自收集数据以来，有任何重要因素改变了吗？

#### SURVEY

#### 调查

> Surveys are among the most common tools used by professionals, particularly in the social sciences. Because the data obtained from surveys are quantifiable, surveys are often included under the broad heading of statistics. However, we are considering them separately to highlight one distinguishing characteristic: Surveys typically obtain data by contacting, not every individual in the group \(known as a population\), but a representative sample of the group. Surveys are conducted by telephonecontact, mail, or personal interview. The sampling may be random, systematic \(for example, every tenth or hundredth person in a telephone directory\), or stratified \(the exact proportion of the component members of the group; for example, 51 percent women and 49 percent men\).

调查是专业人士（特别是社会科学中的）最常用的工具。因为从调查中收集的数据是可量化的，调查通常包括在统计的大标题之下。然而我们正单独考虑它们，以强调一个明显的特征：调查通常并不是通过接触团体中的每个人（称为群体），而是通过接触群体中代表性样本获得数据。调查通过电话联系，邮件或者个人采访进行的。样本可能是随机的、也可能是系统的（如，电话簿中每第十个人或第一百个人），或者分层的（团体中的组成成员是确切的比例；如51%的男人和49%的男人）。

> “Public attitudes toward most social issues,” Joel Best warns, “are too complex to be classified in simple pros and cons, or to be measured by a single survey question.” Moreover, those who conduct surveys realize that “the way questions are worded affects results,” and, if they are dis-honest, they can frame their questions in a way that advances their personal agendas.2

Joel Best 警告说“对大多数社会问题的公众态度太过复杂，无法用简单的正反面分类，或者通过一份调查问卷测量。”此外，这些展开调查的人意识到“问题的措辞会影响结果”，并且，如果他们说谎，他们可以用一种推进个人议程的方式设计问题。

> When evaluating a survey, ask, Was the sample truly representative?That is, did all members of the total population surveyed have an equal chance of being selected? Were the questions clear and unambiguous? Were they objectively phrased rather than slanted? In the case of a mailed survey, did a significant number fail to respond? If so, how might non-respondents differ from respondents? Also, do other surveys corroborate the survey’s findings?

在评估一次调查时，学会问自己，样本真的具有代表性吗？就是说，被调查人口中的所有人被选中的机会均等吗？问题是清晰明确的吗？问题是客观措辞而不是有倾向的吗？在邮件调查中，有大量的失败回复吗？如果这样的话，非调查对象如何不同于调查对象？另外，有其它调查也证实了这个调查结果吗？

#### FORMAL OBSERVATION

#### 正式的观察

> There are two kinds of formal observational studies. In detached observation the observer does not interact with the individuals being studied. A child psychologist, for example, might visit a school playgroundand watch how the children behave. In participant observation the researcher is involved in the activity being studied. An anthropologist who lived with a nomadic tribe for a period of months, sharing mealswith them and taking part in their communal activities, would be a participant observer.

有两种形式的观察研究。在隔离观察中，观察者不接触被研究对象。例如，一位儿童心理学家可能会到一个学校操场去观察孩子的行为。在参与观察中，研究者参与被研究对象的活动。一位人类学家与游牧部落一起生活几个月，与他们共享食物，参加他们的公共活动，则他就是一个参与观察者。

> When evaluating formal observation, ask, Is it likely that the presence of the observer distorted the behavior being observed? Was the observation of sufficient duration to permit the conclusions that were drawn? Do th e conclusions overgeneralize? \(For example, the observations made of a single nomadic group might be generalized to all nomadic groups, ignoring the fact that other nomadic groups may differ in important ways.\)

在评估正式观察的时，学会问自己，观察者的存在是否可能会扭曲观察到的行为？`观察的时间是否足够证明得出的结论？`结论是否过度概括？（例如，由单个游牧团体的观点可能会被推广到所有的游牧团体，而忽略了其他游牧团体在某些重要方面可能存在差异的事实。）

#### RESEARCH REVIEW

#### 研究综述

> This kind of study is undertaken when a considerable body of research has already been done on a subject. The reviewer examines all the scholarly studies that have been done and then summarizes and compares their findings. Often dozens or even hundreds of studies are examined. A thorough review of research reveals areas of agreement and disagreement and provides a valuable overview of the current state of knowledge on the subject. For example, in reviewing the research on the impact of TV on adolescents, Victor Strasburger examined many research studies,including three “super studies”—one covering 67 separate studies, an-other 230 studies, and another 188 studies.3

当对一个项目做完大量的研究时，就会展开这种类型的研究。审稿人审查已完成的所有学术研究，然后总结和比较它们的发现。通常会审查几十甚至上百个研究。一次彻底的研究综述揭示了相同和不同意见，并对项目的知识现状提供了宝贵概述。例如，在审查电视对青少年影响的研究时， 维克托·斯特拉斯堡（Victor Strasburger）审查了许多调查研究，包括三个“超级研究”——一个覆盖67个独立研究，一个230个研究，以及还有一个188个研究。

> When evaluating a research review, ask, Do the reviewer’s conclusions seem reasonable given the research covered in the review? Has the reviewer omitted any relevant research? \(As a layperson, you may find the latter question impossible to answer yourself. You could, however, ask it of another expert in the field who is familiar with both the actual research and the review.\)

当评估一次研究综述时，学会问自己，考虑到研究综述，研究者的结论看起来是合理的吗？研究者有漏掉任何相关研究吗？（作为一个外行人，你可能发现第二个问题无法回答。然而，你可以向领域中另一位同时熟悉实际调查和概述的专家询问。）

> One additional question is applicable to all kinds of evidence: Is this evidence relevant to the issue under consideration? If it is not relevant, it deserves no consideration, no matter how excellent it may be in other respects. Here is an actual example of an issue that has been badly confused by the use of irrelevant evidence. For years, many college administrators rejected instructors’ requests for a reduction in class size for courses such as writing, speaking, and critical thinking. The administrators cited scholarly studies demonstrating that teaching effectiveness is unrelated to class size—in other words, that teachers can be as effective with fifty students in the classroom as they are with fifteen. Yet the scholarly studies in question examined only courses that impart information, not those that develop skills. For the latter, the very courses in question, the evidence had no relevance.

另外一个问题对所有类型的证据都适用： 这个证据和正在考虑的问题相关吗？如果不相关，则无论这证据在其他方面多屌都不值得考虑。这里有一个使用无关证据严重混淆问题的实际例子。多年来，许多大学管理者拒绝了教师对于写作、口语和理性思维等课程减少班级规模的请求。管理者引用学术研究证明教学效果与班级规模无关——换句话说，老师面对教室里的50名学生和面对15名学生的效果一样。然而，该学术研究只审查了传授信息的课程，而不是那些发展技能的课程。对于后者来说，证据没有相关性。
