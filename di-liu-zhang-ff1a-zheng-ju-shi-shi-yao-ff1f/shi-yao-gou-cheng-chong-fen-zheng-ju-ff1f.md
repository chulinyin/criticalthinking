> It is seldom easy to decide when your evidence, or that of the person whose opinion you are evaluating, is sufficient. In making your determination you will have to consider both the quantity and the quality of the evidence. No simple formula exists, but these general guidelines will help you decide particular cases:

判断你的证据或你正在评判的人的观点的证据是否充分很不容易。在做决定时你将不得不同时考虑证据的数量和质量。不存在简单的公式，但是这些一般准则会帮助你解决特殊的情况：

1. > Evidence is sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Wishing, assuming, or pretending that a judgment is correct does not constitute certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute. The standard for conviction in a criminal trial, for example, is “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Certainty is a very difficult standard to meet, especially in controversial issues,so generally you will be forced to settle for a more modest standard.

   当证据充分时，可以确定地做出判断。希望、假设或者假装一个判断是正确的并不能构成确定性。确定性存在于没有怀疑理由，没有争论基础时。比如，在刑事审判中定罪的标准是“无理由怀疑”。确定性是一个很难满足的标准，特别是在有争议的问题上，因此一般来说，你将被迫设置一个更适度的标准。

2. > If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability. This means that the view in question is demonstrably more reasonable than any competing view.In civil court cases this standard is expressed as “a preponderance of the evidence.” Demonstrating reasonableness is, of course, very different from merely asserting it, and all possible views must be identified and evaluated before any one view can be established as most reasonable.

   如果确定性是难以实现的，那么当问题的一个观点被证明有可能性时，证据是充分的。这意味着，这个观点比任何竞争的观点明显更合理。在民事案件中，这种标准被表达为“优势证据”。证明合理性显然非常不同于仅仅断言它，必须确认和评估所有可能的观点，才能确定最合理的观点。

3. > In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient. In otherwords, if the evidence does not show one view to be more reasonable than competing views, the only prudent course of action is to withhold judgment until sufficient evidence is available. Such restraint can be difficult, especially when you favor a particular view, but restraint is an important characteristic of the critical thinker.

   在所有其它情况下，必须认为证据是不足的。换句话说，如果证据没有表明一个观点比其它观点更合理，则唯一谨慎的做法是保留判断，直到拥有充分的证据。这种克制是困难的，特别是当你赞成一个特殊的观点时，但同时它又是理性思考者的一个重要特征。
