We all like to think of ourselves as totally objective, equally open to either side of every issue. But that is rarely the case. Even if we have not yet taken a firm position on an issue at the outset of our evaluation, we will usually be tilted in one direction or the other by our overall philosophy of life, our political or social views, our opinions on related issues, or our attitude toward the people associated with the various views. This tilting, also known as bias, may be so slight that it has little or no effect on ourjudgment. On the other hand, it may be significant enough to short-circuitcritical thinking. The more we tilt on an issue, the greater our thinking deficit is likely to be.

我们都喜欢把自己看成是完全客观的，对每个问题的任何一放都同样开放的。但那种情况很罕见。即使在评估一开始的时候，我们还没有对一个问题采取坚定立场，但通过我们总体的生活哲学、政治或社会观、对相关问题的观点或者我们对与各种看法相关的人的态度，我们通常会倾斜于一边或者另一边。一方面，这种倾斜（也称为偏见）可能是如此的轻微，以致于它对我们的判断很少或者没有影响。另一方面，对于短暂的理性思维来说，它可能是足够重要的。在一个问题上我们越倾斜，我们的思维缺陷很可能就越大。

> How can you tell when bias is hindering your evaluation of evidence? Look for one or more of these signs:

什么时候偏见阻碍你对证据的评估呢？寻找以下迹象：

* > You approach your evaluation wanting one side to be proved right.

  你接近评估，但想要一方被证明是对的。

* > You begin your investigation assuming that familiar views will prove correct.

  你开始调查，但假设熟悉的观点将被证明是正确的。

* > You look for evidence that supports the side of the issue you favor and ignore evidence that opposes it.

  你寻找支持你赞同一方的证据，忽略反对一方的证据。

* > You rate sources by how favorable they are to your thinking rather than by their reliability and the quality of their research.

  你通过来源对你的想法是多么有利来评估来源，而不是它们的可靠性以及它们的研究质量。

* > You are nitpickingly critical of evidence for views you oppose and uncritical of evidence for views you favor.

  你对你所反对的观点的证据挑剔批判，对你所喜爱的观点的证据不加批判。

* > When you encounter evidence that opposes your bias, you begin arguing against it, often before you have completed examining it.

  当你遇到反对你的偏见的证据时，你经常在已经完整调查之前开始争吵反对它。

> Although you may not be able to eliminate your biases, you can nevertheless identify and control them, and that is all that is necessary. The purpose of evaluating evidence is to discover the truth, regardless of whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, and the only way to do so is to evaluate fairly. Such an evaluation will sometimes require you to conclude that the view you leaned toward \(or actually held\) is mistaken.

虽然你可能无法消除你的偏见，但你仍然可以辨认并控制它们，而这一切都是必要的。评估证据的目的是发现真相，无论它是否令人愉快，而且达到该目的的唯一方式就是公平地评判。这种评判有时会要求你得出结论：你所倾向（或实际持有）的看法是错误的。

> When the evidence supports such a conclusion, have the courage to embrace it. Changing your mind is not dishonorable, but maintaining a false view in order to save face is not only foolish but also intellectually dishonest.

当证据支持这样一个结论时，勇敢地接受它。改变主意并不可耻，但为了保全面子而维持一个错误的观点不仅愚蠢而且智力上不诚实。
