> History records numerous occasions when the expert opinion has been the wrong opinion. In ancient times the standard medical opinion was that headaches were caused by demons inside the skull. The accepted treatment ranged from opening the skull and releasing the demons to giving medicines derived from cow’s brain and goat dung. \(Some Native American tribes preferred beaver testicles.\)4

历史记录了多次，以前专家观点一直是错误的。在古代，标准医学观念是头痛是由头骨中的恶魔造成的。接受的治疗范围从开颅释放恶魔到给予从牛脑和羊粪中获得的药物。（一些印第安人部落更喜欢海狸睾丸。）

> When the idea of inoculating people against diseases such as small-pox first arrived in the colonies in the early 1700s, most authorities regarded it as nonsense. Among them were Benjamin Franklin and a number of the men who later founded Harvard Medical School. Against the authorities stood a relatively unknown man who didn’t even have a medical degree, Zabdiel Boylston. Whose opinion was proved right? Not the experts’ but Zabdiel Boylston’s.5

当为人类注射疾病预防针（如天花）的想法首先在18世纪的殖民地出现的时候，大多数专家认为这是没有意义的。在他们之中包括杰明·富兰克林（ Benjamin Franklin ）以及一些之后创建哈弗医学院的人。反对专家们的是一个相对不知名，没有医学学位的 Zabdiel Boylston。但他的观点最终被证明是正确的，而不是专家们的。

> In 1890 a Nobel Prize–winning bacteriologist, Dr. Robert Koch,reported that he had found a substance that would cure tuberculosis. When it was injected into patients, though, it was found to cause further illness and even death.

在19世纪90年代，获得诺贝尔奖的细菌学家 Robert Koch 博士报告称他已经发现了一种可以治疗肺结核的东西。然而当它被注射给病人的时候，发现它会造成更多的疾病，甚至死亡。

> In 1904 psychologist G. Stanley Hall expressed his professional opinion that when women engage in strenuous mental activity, particularly with men, they experience a loss of mammary function and interest in motherhood, as well as decreased fertility. If they subsequently have children, the children will tend to be sickly. 6 Today this idea is laughable.

在1904年，心理学家 G. Stanley Hall 表达他的专业观点称，当女人从事剧烈的心理活动，特别是和男人，她们会丧失乳房功能和对母亲身份的兴趣，以及降低生育能力。如果他们之后有了孩子，孩子往往会多病。今天这个观点是荒唐可笑的，

> Between 1919 and 1922 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New YorkCity bought seventeen gold vessels that experts determined were authentic treasures from a 3,500-year-old Egyptian tomb. In 1982 the vessels were discovered to be twentieth-century fakes.7

在1919年和1922年之间，纽约的大都艺术博物馆购买了17只金船，它们被专家确定为是来自3500年前埃及坟墓的珍宝。在1982年，这些船被发现是20世纪的赝品。

> In 1928 a drug called thorotrast was developed and used to outline certain organs of the body so that clearer X-rays could be taken. Nineteen years later, doctors learned that even small doses of the drug caused cancer.

在1928年，一种名为二氧化钍的药物被开发并用于画出身体某些器官的轮廓，以便可以拍摄更清晰的X射线。19年后，医生们发现即使是小剂量的这种药物也会导致癌症。

> In 1959 a sedative called thalidomide was placed on the market.Many physicians prescribed it for pregnant women. Then, when a large number of babies were born deformed, medical authorities realized that thalidomide was to blame.

在1959年，一种名为萨力多胺的镇静剂被放到市场上。许多医生为孕妇开这种药。然后，当大量婴儿出生畸形的时候，医学专家意识到萨力多胺是罪魁祸首。

> In 1973, using refined radar mapping techniques, scientists decided that their earlier claims about the surface of Venus were wrong. It was not smooth, as they had thought, but pockmarked with craters.8

在1973年，通过使用改进的雷达测绘技术，科学家们认为他们早期关于金星表面的说法是错误的。它并不如他们所想是光滑的，而是遍布陨石坑。

> In the 1980s and 1990s one of the hottest topics in the publishing and seminar industries was co-dependency. Anyone related to an alcoholic or drug addict was considered to be a contributor to the problem, chiefly by unconsciously encouraging the person’s habit or enabling the person to indulge it. Soon the idea of co-dependency became the diagnosis of choice for any situation characterized by out-of-control behavior. Co-dependents were urged to buy books, attend seminars, and join their troubled family member in counseling. Then one curious researcher, Edith Gomberg,examined the scientific research base on which the movement was founded. She found . . . zip, nada, nothing. In her words, “There are no surveys, no clinical research, no evaluations; only descriptive, impressionistic statements.”9

20世纪80年代和90年代，在出版商和行业研讨会中最热门的话题之一是相互依存。任何与酒鬼或者瘾君子有关的人都被认为是该问题的促成因素，主要通过无意识地鼓励个人习惯或者使个人沉迷其中。很快，相互依存的观念成为了对任何以失控行为为特征的情况的首选诊断法。共同抚养人被敦促买书、参加研讨会、与他们陷入困境的家庭成员一起咨询。接着一名好奇的研究者 Edith comberg 审查了行为建立的科学研究基础。她发现...零，什么都没有。用她的话说，“没有调查，没有临床研究，没有评估；只有描述性的，让人印象深刻的语句。”

> For most of the twentieth century, the universally accepted scientific opinion was that stomach ulcers are caused by excess stomach acid gener-ated by stress. Then Barry Marshall demonstrated that ulcers are caused by bacteria and can be cured with antibiotics.

在20世纪的大部分时间，普遍接受的科学观点是，胃溃疡是由紧张产生的过多胃酸引起的。接着 Barry Marshall 证明溃疡是由细菌引起的，并可以用抗生素治愈。

> Remember the brontosaurus with his head stretching to the treetops in Jurassic Park? That scene reflected the traditional scientific opinion that the big dinosaurs dined on leaves thirty or more feet off the ground. In1999, however, Michael Parrish, a northern Illinois researcher, experimented with a computer model of the neck bones of large dinosaurs and discovered that they could never have lifted their heads above the level of their bodies. If they had, their neck vertebrae would have collapsed. They couldn’t have stood on their hind legs, either, because the demands on their blood pressure would have been excessive.10

还记得侏罗纪公园中把头伸到树梢的雷龙吗？这个场景反映了一个传统科学观念，即大型恐龙在离地面30多英尺的地方吃树叶。然而，在1999年，北伊利诺斯州的研究者 Michael Parrish 用一个大型恐龙颈骨的电脑模型做实验，发现它们永远不能将它们的头部抬高到它们身体的水平之上。如果它们做到了，它们的颈椎将会崩溃。他们也不能依靠后腿站立，因为这对它们血压的要求过高。

> For years physicians told us that fiber lowers cholesterol and protects against colon cancer. Eventually, medical research established that it doesn’t lower cholesterol. Then researchers demonstrated that it doesn’t protect against colon cancer.11

多年以来医生告诉我们纤维可以降低胆固醇并预防结肠癌。最终，医学研究证实它不能降低胆固醇。接着研究者还证明它不能防止结肠癌。

> To this day, many experts are convinced that the cause of crime is a bad social environment and that the solution is to pour millions of dollars into poor neighborhoods for a variety of social programs. Other experts are equally convinced that the cause of crime is an emotional disorder that can be cured only by psychological counseling. But a leading researcher, Stanton Samenow, disputes both views. Samenow argues that “bad neighborhoods, inadequate parents, television, schools, drugs, or unemployment” are not the cause of crime—criminals themselves are. They break the law not because conditions force them to but because they choose to, and they choose to because they consider themselves special and therefore above the law. In Samenow’s view, the key to criminals’ rehabilitation is for them to accept responsibility for their behavior.12 Is Samenow correct? Time will tell.

现在，许多专家相信犯罪的起因是糟糕的社会环境，而解决办法是投入数百万美元到贫民区用于各种社会事业。而其他专家相信犯罪的起因是情绪障碍，只有通过心理咨询才能治愈。但是著名的研究者 Stanton Samenow 对这两个观点表示怀疑。他主张“糟糕的邻居、不称职的父母、电视、学校、药物或者失业者”不是犯罪的起因——而犯罪本身才是。人们违反法律不是因为形势所迫而是因为他们选择犯罪，而他们选择犯罪是因为他们认为他们自己是特殊的，因此可以凌驾于法律之上。在 Samenow 看来，罪犯改过自新的关键是他们为自己的行为负责。Smenow 对吗？时间会告诉我们答案。

> It is impossible to know what expert opinions of our time will be overturned by researchers in the future. But we can be sure that some will be. And they may well be views that today seem unassailable.

我们不可能知道我们现在的哪些家观点会被未来的研究者推翻。但是我们可以确信某些将会被推翻，并且它们可能是现在看起来不容置疑的观点。
