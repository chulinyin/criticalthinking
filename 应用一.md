> Note: One of the best ways to develop your thinking \(and writing\) skills is to record your observations, questions, and ideas in a journal and then, as time permits, to reflect on what you have recorded—considering the meaning and application of the observations, answering the questions, elaborating on the ideas \(and, where appropriate, challenging them\), and recording your insights. An inexpensive bound notebook or spiral notebook will serve the purpose. A good approach is to record your initial observations, questions, and ideas on the left side of the page, leaving the right side blank for your later analysis and commentary. The value of this reflective process is so great that you should consider keeping such a journal even if your instructor does not make it a formal part of the course.

注意：发展你思考（和写作）技能的最好途径之一就是在一本笔记本中记录你的观察、问题和想法，只要时间允许，反省你记录的东西——考虑观察的意义和应用，回答问题，阐述思想（并且在适当的时候挑战它们），并且记录你的领悟。一个便宜的装订笔记本将服务于这个目的。一个好的方法是，在页面的左边记录你的初步观察、问题和想法，为你之后的分析和注释留出右边。这个反思过程的价值是如此之大，以至于你应该考虑始终带着这样一个笔记本，即使你的老师没有使之成为课程的正式组成部分。

1. > Do a brief study of attention shifts such as the one described in the chapter. Record a half-hour show. Then play the show back twice, the first time counting the number of shifts within the program, excluding commercials, and the second time counting only those within commercials. Complete the necessary arithmetic and be prepared to share your results in class.

  为本章描述的注意力转移做一个简短的研究。记录一个一个半小时的秀。接着会看两次，第一次数在节目中除了广告的转移数，第二次仅仅数这些广告中的转移数。完成必要的计算，准备在教师中分享你的结果。

2. > Reflect on your findings in application 1. Write several paragraphs discussing the implications of those findings for education, business, and family life.

  反思你在应用1中的发现。写几段话讨论这些发现对教育、商业和家庭生活的影响。

3. > Many people cheerfully pay $6 or $7 a gallon for designer drinking water but moan and groan when they have to pay $3 a gallon for gasoline. Does anything you read in this chapter help you understand why this is so?

  许多人乐意为设计师饮用水支付 6 或 7 美元一加仑，但是当他们不得不为汽油支付 3 美元一加仑时却唉声叹气。你在本章中国读到的任何东西帮助你理解为什么会是这样吗？

4. > Imagine how different America might be if Frankl’s emphasis on self-transcendence and personal responsibility, rather than Maslow’s emphasis on self-actualization and popular culture’s emphasis on self-esteem, had been dominant for the past fifty years. List as many ways as you can in which our society might be different today and comment on whether each would be beneficial or harmful. Be prepared to explain your views in class discussion.

  想象一下，如果 Frankl 对自我超越和个人责任 的强调 ，而不是 Maslow 对自我实现的强调和流行文化对自尊的强调，在过去五十年一直占据主导地位，美国可能会怎样不同？列出尽可能多的今天我们社会可能不同的方式，并且评论每个将变得有益还是有害。准备在课堂讨论中准备解释你的看法。

5. > Watch one of the music video channels—MTV, VH1, CMT, BET— for at least an hour. Analyze how men and women are depicted in the videos. Note significant details. For example, observe whether men are depicted in power roles more than women and whether women are portrayed as objects of male desire. Decide what attitudes and values are conveyed. \(You might want to record as you are watching so that you can review what you have seen, freeze significant frames for closer analysis, and keep your observations for later reference or class viewing and discussion.\)

  从影视频道 MTV, VH1, CMT, BET 中选出一个，至少看一小时。分析在视频中男人和女人是如何被描述的。注意重要的细节。例如，观察是否男人比女人更多地被描述成权利角色，是否女人被描述成男人渴望的事物。确定被什么态度和价值观被传达了。（当你观看的时候，你可能想要做记录以便你可以回顾你看了什么，为了更近距离地分析而定格关键帧，为了之后的引用或者课堂查看和讨论而保持你的观察。）

6. > Suppose you asked a friend, “How did you acquire your particular identity—your sentiments and preferences and attitudes?” Then suppose the friend responded, “I’m an individual. No one else influences me. I do my own thing, and I select the sentiments and preferences and attitudes that suit me.” How would you explain to your friend what you learned in this chapter?

  假设你问一个朋友，“你是如何获得你特别的个性——你的情感、偏好和态度的？”然后假设这个朋友回应，“我是一个个体。没有其他人影响我。我做自己的事情，并且选择适合我的情感、偏好和态度。”你将如何向你朋友解释你在本章中学到的？

7. > Ask yourself the question, Who am I? Write down ten answers to this question, each on a separate slip of paper. Use the first three paragraphs of this chapter to help you frame your answers. Arrange the pieces of paper in order of their importance to you. Then explain the arrangement—that is, which selfdescriptions are most important to you, and why?

  问你自己，“我是谁？”，并在纸上写下十个答案，每个答案一张纸。利用本章的前三段帮助你构建你的答案。按照它们对你的重要性为它们进行排序。然后解释一下这个安排——哪个自我描述对你而言是最重要的，为什么？

8. > Identify the various positive and negative influences that have shaped you. Be sure to include the particular as well as the general and the subtle as well as the obvious influences. Which of those influences have had the greatest effect on you? Explain the effects as precisely as you can.
