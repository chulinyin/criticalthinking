Note: One of the best ways to develop your thinking \(and writing\) skills is to record your observations, questions, and ideas in  a journal and then, as time permits, to reflect on what you have recorded—considering the meaning and application of the  observations, answering the questions, elaborating on the ideas \(and, where appropriate, challenging them\), and recording  your insights. An inexpensive bound notebook or spiral notebook will serve the purpose. A good approach is to record your  initial observations, questions, and ideas on the left side of the page, leaving the right side blank for your later analysis and  commentary. The value of this reflective process is so great that you should consider keeping such a journal even if your  instructor does not make it a formal part of the course.

1. Do a brief study of attention shifts such as the one described in the chapter. Record a half-hour show. Then play the show  back twice, the first time counting the number of shifts within the program, excluding commercials, and the second time  counting only those within commercials. Complete the necessary arithmetic and be prepared to share your results in class.

2. Reflect on your findings in application 1. Write several paragraphs discussing the implications of those findings for education, business, and family life.

3. Many people cheerfully pay $6 or $7 a gallon for designer drinking water but moan and groan when they have to pay $3 a  gallon for gasoline. Does anything you read in this chapter help you understand why this is so?

4. Imagine how different America might be if Frankl’s emphasis on selftranscendence and personal responsibility, rather than  Maslow’s emphasis on self-actualization and popular culture’s emphasis on self-esteem, had been dominant  for the past fifty  years. List as many ways as you can in which our society might be different today and comment on whether each would be  beneficial or harmful. Be prepared to explain your views in class discussion.

5. Watch one of the music video channels—MTV, VH1, CMT, BET— for at least an hour. Analyze how men and women are  depicted in the videos. Note significant details. For example, observe whether men are depicted in power roles more than  women and whether women are portrayed as objects of male desire. Decide what attitudes and values are conveyed. \(You  might want to record as you are watching so that you can review what you have seen, freeze significant frames for closer  analysis, and keep your observations for later reference or class viewing and discussion.\)

6. Suppose you asked a friend, “How did you acquire your particular identity—your sentiments and preferences and attitudes?”  Then suppose the friend responded, “I’m an individual. No one else influences me. I do my own thing, and I select the  sentiments and preferences and attitudes that suit me.” How would you explain to your friend what you learned in this chapter?

7. Ask yourself the question, Who am I? Write down ten answers to this question, each on a separate slip of paper. Use the  first three paragraphs of this chapter to help you frame your answers. Arrange the pieces of paper in order of their importance  to you. Then explain the arrangement—that is, which selfdescriptions are most important to you, and why?

8. Identify the various positive and negative influences that have shaped you. Be sure to include the particular as well as the  general and the subtle as well as the obvious influences. Which of those influences have had the greatest effect  on you? Explain the effects as precisely as you can.

9. Note your immediate reaction to each of the following statements. Then apply the four guidelines given in this chapter for  achieving individuality.

  1. Health care workers should be required to be tested for HIV\/AIDS.

  2. Beauty contests and talent competitions for children should be banned.

  3.  Extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan should be allowed to hold rallies on public property or be issued permits to hold  parades on city streets.

  4. Freshman composition should be a required course for all students.

  5. High school and college athletes should be tested for anabolic steroid use.

  6. Creationism should be taught in high school biology classes.

  7. Polygamy should be legalized.

  8. The voting age should be lowered to sixteen.
  9. The prison system should give greater emphasis to the punishment of inmates than to their rehabilitation.
  10. Doctors and clinics should be required to notify parents of minors when they prescribe birth control devices or facilitate  abortions for the minors.
  11. Aman’s self-esteem is severely injured if his wife makes more money than he makes.

  12. Women like being dependent on men.


10. Group discussion exercise: Discuss several of the statements in application 9 with two or three of your classmates,  applying the four guidelines presented in this chapter for developing individuality. Be prepared to share your group’s ideas with the class.
