> Is perception flawless? Hardly. For one thing, it is influenced by our desires, interests, and expectations: “From the outset perception is selective and tends to simplify the world around us. Memory continues and hastens the process.”2 For another, even within its limited focus, perception is often flawed. A college student who is positive that the textbook contains a certain statement answers an exam question with perfect confidence. Yet when the student gets the corrected test back and finds the question marked wrong, then hurriedly flips open the book and examines thepassage again, he or she may find it says something else entirely.

感觉是否完美？几乎不。一方面，它受我们的欲望、兴趣和期望影响：“从一开始，感觉就是选择性的，并倾向于简化我们周围的世界。记忆持续并加快进程。”另一方面，甚至在它受限的重点内，感觉经常是不完美的。一个肯定教科书包含确定答案的大学生，以完美的自信回答一个考试问题。然而当学生取回批改卷，发现问题被标为错误，接着匆忙翻阅书本，再次检查试卷，他／她可能发现它说的完全不同。

> Moviegoers in the 1930s and 1940s were thrilled as Tarzan uttered his famous yell and swung through the treetops to catch the villain. Tell them that Tarzan never made that yell and they’ll say, “False, we heard itwith our own ears.” And yet it’s not false. According to one of the men who first played the role of Tarzan, Buster Crabbe, that yell was dubbed into the films in the studio. It was a blend of three voices—a soprano ’s, a baritone’s, and a hog caller ’s.

当泰山发出了他著名的喊叫并在树梢间摆动追捕坏蛋的时候，20世纪30、40年代的电影观众被震撼了。告诉他们泰山从没那样叫，他们会说，“错，我们用自己的耳朵听到了。”然而这没有错。根据第一个扮演泰山的男人 Buster Crabbe，那个叫声是在录音室被配进电影的。那是三种声音的混合——女高音，男中音和猪叫声。

> At least a dozen times every weekend from September to January, the imperfection of human observation is underlined by that marvel of technology, the instant replay. Is there a football fan anywhere who doesn’t occasionally scream, “Bad call!” only to be proved wrong a moment later? We can be sure enough to bet a week’s wages that the pass receiver’s feet came down inbounds or that the running back’s knee hit the ground before the ball came loose. And then the replay shows us how erroneous our initial perception was.

从9月到1月，每个周末至少十几次，人类的观察缺陷被科技的奇迹——即时重放，所强调。哪里有球迷不偶尔尖叫，“糟糕的判罚！”，片刻之后仅被证明是错误的？我们能够十分确信地赌一星期的工资，传球接受者的脚下落界内或者跑锋的膝盖在球松前撞到了地面。接着回放告诉我们我们的初始感觉是多么错误。

> The vagaries of perception have long been noted by those who deal with human testimony—notably, trial lawyers, police officers, and psychologists. It is well established that a number of factors can make us see and hear inaccurately. Darkness, cloudy conditions, or distance from what we are witnessing may obscure our vision. We may be distracted at a crucial moment. If we are tired or in the grip of powerful emotions such as fear or anger, our normal perceptiveness may be significantly diminished. Also, perception may be intermingled with interpretation—the expectation that an event will unfold in a certain way may color our perception of the way the event actually unfolds. Loyalty and affection toward the people or things involved may distort our vision as well. If someone we dislike speaks in a loud voice and is animated, we may regard that person as showing off to get attention. But if a friend behaves in the same way, we may regard him or her as vivacious and extroverted.

那些处理人类证词的人——尤其是，出庭律师、警察和心理学家，长期以来一直注意感觉的变幻莫测。众所周知，大量因素可以使我们不准确地看和听。黑暗、阴天的条件、或者我们正在目击的距离都可能掩盖我们的视力。我们可能会在一个关键时刻分心。如果我们累了或者受强烈的情绪如害怕或者愤怒控制，我们正常的感知力可能会显著地减少。同样，感知可能会和理解混合——事件将以某种方式展开的期望可能会歪曲我们对事件实际展开方式的感知。对涉及的人或事的忠诚和喜爱同样可能歪曲我们的视力。如果一些我们不喜欢的人大声说话并且活跃的，我们可能将那个人当作正为了得到注意力炫耀。但是如果一个朋友以同样的方式表现，我们可能将他／她当作活泼和外向的。
