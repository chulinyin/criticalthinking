> To me truth is precious. . . . I should rather be right and stand alone than to run with the multitude and be wrong. . . . The holding of the views herein set forth has already won for me the scorn and contempt and ridicule of some of my fellow men. I am looked upon as being odd,strange, peculiar. . . . But truth is truth and though all the world reject it and turn against me, I will cling to truth still.1

对我来说，真理是宝贵的...我应该变得正确和独立而不是变得错误和与众人同行…这里提出的观点已经为我赢得了一些同胞的嘲笑、蔑视以及嘲弄。我被视为奇怪、陌生、特别的...但是真理就是真理，即使全是世界拒绝它并反对我，我还是会抓紧真理。

> Stirring words, those. You can envision their author bravely facing legions of reactionaries intent on imposing their narrow dogmas on him. In the background you can almost hear a chorus singing “Stout-Hearted Men.”Stand tall, brave hero. Never give in!

这些激动人心的话，你可以想象它们的作者勇敢地面对有意将狭隘的教条强加于他的大批反动派。在背景中，你几乎可以听到合唱团唱“勇敢的男人”。站在高处，勇敢的英雄。从不屈服。

> But wait a minute. Just who is the author? And what exactly is the opinion he is valiantly defending? His name is Charles Silvester de Fort.The quotation is from a booklet he wrote in 1931. And the opinion is—are you ready for this?—that the earth is flat.

但是等一会儿。作者到底是谁？他誓死捍卫的观点到底是什么？他的名字是 Charles Silvester de Fort 。引文来自于他在1931年写的小册子。观点是——你真的准备好了吗？——地球是平的。

> People have always taken their opinions seriously, but today many people embrace their opinions with extraordinary passion. “I have a right to my opinion” and “Everyone’s entitled to his or her opinion” are common expressions. Question another person’s opinion and you’re likely to hear, “Well, that’s my OPINION.” The unspoken message is “Case closed.”

人们总是认真对待自己的观点，但是今天许多人却以非凡的激情接受他们的观点。“我有权发表我的观点，每个人都有权发表自己的意见”是常见的表达方式。问到另一个人的观点，你可能会听到，“好吧，这是我的观点。”未说出口的信息是"情况关闭"。

> Is that a reasonable view? Is it inappropriate to challenge the opinions of others? The answer depends on the kind of issue involved. If it is a matter of taste, then the standard is the undemanding one of personal preference. If Agnes finds Reginald handsome and Sally disagrees, there’s really no basisfor a meaningful dispute. Ditto if Ralph drools over an orange Camaro with brass wire hubcaps and purple upholstery and Carla is repulsed by it. Some people put catsup on hot dogs, while others prefer mustard or relish, and perhaps at this very moment someone, somewhere, is slathering a hot dog with mayonnaise or blueberries or pureed brussels sprouts. So what? Vive la différence!

这是一个合理的看法吗？挑战其他人的观点是不合适的吗？答案取决于涉及的问题的种类。如果是一个品味问题，那么标准是不严格的个人喜好。如果 Agnes 发现 Reginald很帅，而 Sally 不同意，则真的没有一个有意义的争论的基础。同上，如果 Ralph 垂涎于有铜丝轮毅的橙色大黄蜂以及紫色家具，而 Carla 拒绝这些。有些人在热狗上放番茄酱，而其他人更喜欢芥末或者调味料，而且或许在这个非常时刻，有人在某地正在用蛋黄酱、蓝莓或者蓉抱子甘蓝涂抹热狗。那又怎么样？区别万岁！

> However, consider this very different use of the term opinion: A newspaper reports that the Supreme Court has delivered its opinion in a controversial case. Obviously, the justices did not state their personal preferences, their mere likes and dislikes. They stated their considered judgment, painstakingly arrived at after thorough inquiry and deliberation.

然而考虑"观点"的不同用法：一个新闻报道说，最高法院已经在一个有争议的案件中发表了它的观点。显然，法官不会陈述他们的个人偏好，他们的喜欢和不喜欢。他们陈述他们经过深思熟虑的判断，在彻底地调查和审议后煞费苦心地得出结论。

> In the context of critical thinking, the term opinion refers to expressions of judgment rather than to expressions of taste.**\***In some cases, unfortunately, it is not clear whether someone is expressing taste or judgment. A friend might say to you, as you leave a movie theater, “That was a wonderful film,” which could mean “I liked it” or “It meets a very high standard of cinematography.” If she is merely saying she liked it, and you didn’t, the disagreement would be over personal taste, which is pointless to debate. However, if she is making an aesthetic judgment, you could reasonably challenge her, citing specific film standards the movie failed to meet.

在理性思维的上下文中，观点一词指的是判断的表达，而不是品味的表达。不幸的是，在某些情况中，某人是在表达品味还是判断是不清楚的。当你离开一个电影院时，朋友可能会对你说，“这是一部很棒的电影”，这可能意味着“我喜欢它”或者“它符合非常高的电影摄制艺术标准”。如果她只是说她喜欢它，而你不喜欢，分歧将是个人品味上的，而这种争论是无意义的。然而，如果她正在做审美判断，你可以合理地挑战她的审美，指出该电影没能满足的具体电影标准。

* > \*Judgment and taste may, of course, be present in the mind without being expressed. And though we can evaluate our own judgments whether they are expressed or not, we can evaluate other people’s judgments only when they are expressed. Hence, our definition specifies expressed judgments.

  当然，判断和品味可能出现在脑中没有表达。虽然我们可以评估我们自己的判断而不论它们是否被表达，但是当其他人的判断被表达的时候，我们才可以评估它们。因此，`我们的描述具体说明了明确的判断。`

> Is everyone entitled to his or her opinion? In a free country this is not only permitted but guaranteed. In Great Britain, for example, there is still a Flat Earth Society. As the name implies, the members of this organization believe that the earth is not spherical but flat. In this country, too, each of us is free to take as bizarre a position as we please about any matter we choose. When the telephone operator announces, “That’ll be ninety-five cents for the first three minutes,” you may respond, “No, it won’t—it’ll be twenty-eight cents.” When the service station attendant notifies you, “Your oil is down a quart,” you may reply, “Wrong—it’s up three.”

每个人都有权发表自己的观点吗？在一个自由国家这不仅是允许而且是有保证的。例如，在英国还有平面地球协会。顾名思义，这个组织的成员认为地球不是球形而是平的。在这个国家中，`在任何事情上，每个人都可自由采取使自己高兴的奇怪立场`。当电话接线员宣布“开始的三分钟需要95美分”，你可以回答“不，它将是28美分”。当加油站服务员通知你，“你的油下降了一夸脱”，你可能回答“错，它还大于3”。

> Being free to hold an opinion and express it does not, of course, guarantee favorable consequences. The operator may hang up on you, and the service station attendant may respond unpleasantly.

自由地持有观点并表达它，当然不保证良好的后果。接线员可能挂断你的电话，而加油站服务员可能反应不愉快。

> Acting on our opinions carries even less assurance. Consider the case of the California couple who took their eleven-year-old diabetic son to a faith healer. Secure in their opinion that the man had cured the boy, they threw away his insulin. Three days later, the boy died. The parents remained unshaken in their belief, expressing the opinion that God would raise the boy from the dead. The police arrested them, charging them with manslaughter. 2 The law in such matters is both clear and reasonable: We are free to act on our opinions only as long as, in doing so, we do not harm others.

按我们的观点行事甚至带来更少的保证。考虑这个情况，加利福尼亚的一对夫妻把他们11岁患有糖尿病的儿子带到信仰治疗师那里。在他们看来治疗师治好了男孩，因此扔掉了他的胰岛素。3天后，男孩死了。父母依然不动摇他们的信念，表示上帝会将小男孩复活。警察逮捕了他们，指控他们过失杀人。在这些事情中法律是清晰并合理的：我们有自由按照我们的观点行事，只要这样做时我们不会伤害其他人。
