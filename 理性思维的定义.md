> Let’s begin by making the important distinction between thinking and feeling. I feel and I think are sometimes used interchangeably, but that practice causes confusion. Feeling is a subjective response that reflects emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously rather than through a conscious mental act. We don’t have to employ our minds to feel angry when we are insulted, afraid when we are threatened, or compassionate when we see a picture of a starving child. The feelings arise automatically.

让我们通过在思考和感觉之间做出重要区分开始。我觉得和我认为有时被互换使用，但是这种做法造成了混淆。感觉是反映情绪、感情或者欲望的一个主观反应；它通常不由自主地发生，而不是通过有意识的精神活动发生。当我们受到辱骂、威胁时，我们不必用我们的头脑去感到愤怒、畏惧，或者当我们看到一张挨饿的孩子的图片时不必用我们的头脑去感到同情。感觉会自动产生。

> Feeling is useful in directing our attention to matters we should think about; it also can provide the enthusiasm and commitment necessary to complete arduous mental tasks. However, feeling is never a good substitute for thinking because it is notoriously unreliable. Some feelings are beneficial, honorable, even noble; others are not, as everyday experience demonstrates. We often feel like doing things that will harm us—for example, smoking, sunbathing without sunscreen, telling off our professor or employer, or spending the rent money on lottery tickets.

感觉有助于使我们的注意力集中到我们应该思考的事情上；它还可以提供必要的热情和责任感来完成艰苦的智力任务。然而，感觉绝不是思考的一个好的替身，因为它众所周知地不可靠。有些感觉是有益的，体面的，甚至高尚的；其他的感觉则不是，正如日常经验所证明。我们经常想要做会伤害到自己的事情——例如，抽烟、晒日光浴不戴太阳眼镜、责备我们的教授或者雇主、或者把借来的钱花在彩票上。

> Zinedine Zidane was one of the greatest soccer players of his generation, and many experts believed that in his final season \(2006\) he would lead France to the pinnacle of soccer success—winning the coveted WorldCup. But then, toward the end of the championship game against Italy, he viciously head-butted an Italian player in full view of hundreds of millions of people. The referee banished him from the field, France lost the match, and a single surrender to feeling forever stained the brilliant career Zidane had dedicated his life to building.

齐内丁·齐达内是他那一代最伟大的足球运动员之一，并且许多专家认为在他的最后一个赛季（2006），他将带领法国到足球胜利的顶峰——赢得梦寐以求的世界杯。然而，接近对抗意大利冠军赛末尾，他在数亿人的众目睽睽之下猛烈地用头撞了一个意大利的球员。裁判把他从赛场驱逐，法国输掉了比赛，对感觉仅有的一次屈服永远玷污了齐达内毕生致力于建立的辉煌生涯。

> In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding.\*Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims beyond itself to knowledge or action. This is not to say that thinking is infallible; in fact, a good part of this book is devoted to exposing errors in thinking and showing you how to avoid them. Yet for all its shortcomings, thinking is the most reliable guide to action we humans possess. To sum up the relationship between feeling and thinking, feelings need to be tested before being trusted, and thinking is the most reasonable and reli-able way to test them.

与感觉相反，思考是为了解决问题、做出决定或获得理解而进行的有意识的心理过程。而感觉没有超越自我表达的目的，思考旨在超越自身到知识或行动。这并不是说思考是绝对可靠的；事实上，本书一个好的部分是致力于揭露思考中的错误，并告诉你如何避免他们。然而，对于它的所有缺点，思考仍是对我们人类具有行为的最可靠指导。总结感觉和思考间的关系，感觉在被相信前需要进行测试，而思考是测试他们的最合理和最可靠的方式。

> There are three broad categories of thinking: reflective, creative, and critical. The focus of this book is on critical thinking. The essence of critical thinking is evaluation. Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest. Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions. Where the uncritical accept their first thoughts and other people’s statements at face value, critical thinkers challenge all ideas in this manner:

有三大类思维：反思性的、创造性的、理性的。本书的重点是理性思维。理性思维的重要本质是评估。因此，理性思维可能被定义为我们测试主张和论点并决定哪些有价值，哪些没有的过程。换句话说，理性思维是对答案的一次搜索和追寻。毫不奇怪，理性思维中使用的最重要的技术之一就是寻根究底地问问题。当不理性思维者接受他们的第一想法和其他人的陈述的表面价值时，理性思维者用这种方式挑战所有的想法。

* > \*Some informal definitions of thinking include daydreaming. It is excluded from this definition because daydreaming is a passive mental state over which we exercise little or no control. It is therefore of little use in evaluating ideas.

  思考的一些非正式定义包括白日梦。它从这里的定义中排除了，因为白日梦时一个被动x的精神状态，在这种状态下，我们很少或者根本没有控制。因此在评估想法中几乎不用。

| Professor Vile cheated me in my composition grade. He weighted some themes more heavily than others. | Did he grade everyone on the same standard? Were the different weightings justified? |
| Before women entered the work force, there were fewer divorces. That shows that a woman’s place is in the home. | How do you know that this factor, and not some other one\(s\), is responsible for the increase in divorces? |
| A college education isn’t worth what you pay for it. Some people never reach a salary level appreciably higher than the level they would have reached without the degree. | Is money the only measure of the worth of an education? What about increased understanding of self and life and increased ability to cope with challenges? |

| 在女人进入劳动队伍之前，离婚较少。这表明一个女人的地方是在家里。 | 你怎么知道是这个，而不是其他因素，是离婚增加的原因？ |
| 大学教育不值得你所为其支付的。一些人从没达到一个明显地高于没有学位情况下将达到的工资水平。 | 金钱是一个教育价值的唯一衡量标准吗？那关于增加对自我和生活的理解，以及增强应付挑战的能力呢？ |

> Critical thinking also employs questions to analyze issues. Consider, for example, the subject of values. When it is being discussed, some people say, “Our country has lost its traditional values” and “There would be less crime, especially violent crime, if parents and teachers emphasized moral values.” Critical thinking would prompt us to ask,

理性思维还利用提问分析问题。例如，考虑价值观主体。当它被讨论时，一些人说，“我们的国家已经失去了它的传统价值观”以及“如果家长和老师强调道德的价值，将会有更少的犯罪，特别是暴力犯罪。”理性思维者将促使我们问，

1. > What is the relationship between values and beliefs? Between values and convictions?

  价值观和信念之间的关系是什么？价值观和定罪之间的关系是什么？

2. > Are all values valuable?

  所有的价值观都是有价值的吗？

3. > How aware is the average person of his or her values? Is it possible that many people deceive themselves about their real values?

  普通人是如何意识到他\/她的价值观的？许多人对他们真实的价值观自我欺骗是否可能？

4. > Where do one’s values originate? Within the individual or outside?In thought or in feeling?

  一个人的价值观起源自哪里？在个体里面还是外面？在思想里面还是在感觉中？

5. > Does education change a person’s values? If so, is this change always for the better?

  教育改变了一个人的价值观吗？如果这样，改变总是为了更好吗？

6. > Should parents and teachers attempt to shape children’s values?

  家长和老师应该试图塑造孩子的价值观吗？
