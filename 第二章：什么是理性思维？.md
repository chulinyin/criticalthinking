> When Arthur was in the first grade, the teacher directed the class to“think.” “Now, class,” she said, “I know this problem is a little harder than the ones we’ve been doing, but I’m going to give you a few extra minutes to think about it. Now start thinking.”

当亚瑟在一年级时，老师指导班级“思考”。“现在，同学们，”她说，“我知道这个问题比我们一直在做的更困难，但是我会给你们一些额外几分钟去思考它。现在开始思考。”

> It was not the first time Arthur had heard the word used. He’d heard it many times at home, but never quite this way. The teacher seemed to be asking for some special activity, something he should know how to start and stop—like his father’s car. “Vroom-m-m,” he muttered half aloud. Because of his confusion, he was unaware he was making the noise.

这不是亚瑟第一次听到这个词了。他已经在家听过好几次，但是从来没有这样。老师似乎正在要求一些特殊的活动，一些他应该知道怎么开始和停止的活动——就像他父亲的汽车。“呜呜呜，”他低声地说。由于他的困惑，他没意识到他正在制造噪音。

> “Arthur, please stop making noises and start thinking.”

“亚瑟，请停止吵闹，开始思考。”

> Embarrassed and not knowing quite what to do, he looked down at his desk. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed that the little girl next to him was staring at the ceiling. “Maybe that’s the way you start thinking,”he guessed. He decided the others had probably learned how to do it last year, that time he was home with the measles. So he stared at the ceiling.

感到尴尬并且不知道干什么，他低头看着他的书桌。接着，从他眼角的余光，他注意到在他旁边的小女孩正盯着天花板。“或许这是你开始思考的方式，”他猜。他确定其他人可能已经在去年学会了怎样去思考，那时候他得麻疹在家。所以他也开始盯着天花板。

> As he progressed through grade school and high school, he heard that same direction hundreds of times. “No, that’s not the answer, you’re not thinking—now think!” And occasionally he would hear from particularly self-pitying teachers given to muttering to themselves aloud: “What did I do to deserve this? Don’t they teach them anything in the grades anymore? Don’t you people care about ideas? Think, dammit, THINK.”

当他在小学和高中的时候，他听到数百次那同样的指示。“不，那不是答案，你没有在思考——现在思考！”并且偶尔他从特别自怨自哀的老师听到他们对自己大声嘟哝：“我做了什么值得这样？他们没有在小学教他们任何东西吗？你们这些人难道不关心想法吗？思考，该死的，思考。”

> So Arthur learned to feel somewhat guilty about the whole matter.Obviously, this thinking was an important activity that he’d failed to learn. Maybe he lacked the brain power. But he was resourceful enough.He watched the other students and did what they did. Whenever a teacher started in about thinking, he screwed up his face, furrowed his brow, scratched his head, stroked his chin, stared off into space or up at the ceiling, and repeated silently to himself, “Let’s see now, I’ve got to think about that, think, think—I hope he doesn’t call on me—think.”

所以亚瑟学会对整件事感到有点内疚。显然，这种想法是一个他没有学到的重要活动。或许他缺少脑力。但他足智多谋。他观察其他学生，做他们所做的。`每当老师开始关于思考`，他苦着脸，皱起眉头，挠他自己的头，抚摸着他的下巴，凝视着空间或天花板，并对他自己默默地重复，“让我们现在看看，我已经开始思考，思考，思考——我希望他不要叫我——思考。”

> Though Arthur didn’t know it, that’s just what the other students were saying to themselves.

然而亚瑟不知道，这就是其他学生正在对他们自己说的。

> Your experience may have been similar to Arthur’s. In other words, many people may have simply told you to think without ever explaining what thinking is and what qualities a good thinker has that a poor thinker lacks. If that is the case, you have a lot of company. Extensive, effective training in thinking is the exception rather than the rule. This fact and its unfortunate consequences are suggested by the following comments from accomplished observers of the human condition:

你的经历可能于亚瑟的相似。换句话说，许多人可能简单地告诉你去思考却不曾解释思考是什么，一个优秀的思考者有什么品质是糟糕的思考者所缺少的。如果情况是这样的，你有很多公司。广泛而有效的思维训练是例外而不是常规。这个事实和它不幸的结果由人类条件的有造诣观察者的以下意见提出：

> The most interesting and astounding contradiction in life is to me the constant insistence by nearly all people upon “logic,” “logical reasoning,”“sound reasoning,” on the one hand, and on the other their inability to display it, and their unwillingness to accept it when displayed by others.1

生活中最有有趣和令人震惊的矛盾对我来说是，一方面，几乎所有人对“逻辑”，“逻辑推理”，“合理推理”的不断坚持，另一方面，他们无能展现它，并且当它被其他人展现时不愿接受它。

> Most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.2

大多数我们所谓的推理，在于寻找继续相信我们已经做的理由。

> Clear thinking is a very rare thing, but even just plain thinking is almost as rare. Most of us most of the time do not think at all. We believe and we feel, but we do not think.3

清晰的思考是一个非常罕见的东西，但即使只是简单的思考也几乎一样罕见。我们大多数人大多数时候一点也不思考。我们相信，我们感觉，但是我们不思考。

> Mental indolence is one of the commonest of human traits.4

精神懒惰是最常见的人类特征之一。

> What is this activity that everyone claims is important but few people have mastered? Thinking is a general term used to cover numerous activities, from daydreaming to reflection and analysis. Here are just some of the synonyms listed in Roget’s Thesaurus for think:

这项活动的什么是每个人说重要的，但几乎没有人掌握的？思考是一个总的术语用于包括大量的活动，从白日梦到深思和分析。这里仅仅是一些在 Roget 的同义词词典中列出的思考的同义词：

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| appreciate | consult | fancy | reason |
| believe | contemplate | imagine | reflect |
| cerebrate | deliberate | meditate | ruminate |
| cogitate | digest | muse | speculate |
| conceive | discuss | ponder | suppose |
| consid | dream | realize | weigh |

> All of those are just the names that thinking goes under. They really don’t explain it. The fact is, after thousands of years of humans’ experiencing thought and talking and writing about thinking, it remains in many respects one of the great mysteries of our existence. Still, though much is yet to be learned, a great deal is already known.

所有这些仅仅是思考的名字。他们真的不解释它。事实是，在数千年人类经历思考，谈论并书写思考之后，它仍然在许多方面是我们存在的伟大奥秘之一。然而，虽然还有很多东西需要学习，但是很多已经知道了。
