> Once ideas are put into words and published, they become intellectual property, and the author has the same rights over them  as he or she has over a material possession such as a house or a car. The only real difference is that intellectual property is  purchased with mental effort rather than money. Anyone who has ever wracked his or her brain trying to solve a problem or  trying to put an idea into clear and meaningful words can appreciate how difficult mental effort can be.

一旦想法变成了文字并发表，它就成为了知识财产，作者对它们拥有权利，就像他/她对房屋和汽车等物质财产拥有权利。唯一真正的区别是知识财产是用精神上的努力而不是金钱购买的。任何曾经破坏他/她的大脑，试图解决一个问题，或者试图把一个想法变成清晰并有意义的文字的人，会领会到精神上的努力是多么困难。

> Plagiarism is passing off other people’s ideas or words as one’s own. It is doubly offensive in that it both steals and deceives.  In the academic world, plagiarism is considered an ethical violation and is punished by a failing grade for a paper or a course  or even by dismissal from the institution. Outside the academy, it is a crime that can be prosecuted if the person to whom the  ideas and words belong wishes to bring charges. Either way, the offender suffers dishonor and disgrace, as the following  examples illustrate:

抄袭是把别人的想法或者文字当作自己的。它是双重无礼的，因为它既偷窃又欺骗。在学术界，抄袭被认为是违反道德的行为，会受到一篇论文或课程的不及格分数的惩罚，甚至被解雇。在学术之外，如果想法和文字的拥有者想要提出指控，这是一种可以被起诉起诉的罪行。无论哪种方式，冒犯者都会遭受侮辱，如下面的例子所示：

* > When a university in South Africa learned that professor Marks Chabel had plagiarized most of his doctoral dissertation from Kimberly Lanegran of the University of Florida, the university fired Chabel. Moreover, the university that had awarded him his  Ph.D. revoked it.

  当南非的一所大学得知教授Marks Chabel的博士论文大多数抄袭自佛罗里达大学的Kimberly Lanegran， 大学解雇了Chabel。另外大学撤销了授予他的博士学位。

* > When U.S. Senator Joseph Biden was seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, it was revealed that he had  plagiarized passages from speeches by British politician Neil Kinnock and by Robert Kennedy. It was also learned that, while in  law school, he had plagiarized a number of pages from a legal article. The ensuing scandal led Biden to withdraw his andidacy  and has continued to stain his reputation. The reputation of historian Stephen Ambrose was tarnished by allegations that over  the years he plagiarized the work of several authors. Doris Kearns Goodwin, historian and advisor to President Lyndon Johnson, suffered a similar embarrassment when she was discovered to have plagiarized from more than one source in one of  her books.

  当美国参议员Joseph Biden正在寻求1988民主党总统候选人提名时，他曾经抄袭了英国政客Neil Kinnock和Robert Kennedy的演讲段落被揭露。还得知，在法学院期间，他从一个法律的文章中抄袭了好几页。随后的丑闻导致Biden撤回候选人资格，并继续玷污他的名声。历史学家Stephen Ambrose的名声被指控多年来他抄袭几个作者的作品败坏。Doris Kearns Goodwin，历史学家和总统Lyndon的顾问，遭受了类似的尴尬，当她被发现她的一本书中抄袭了多个原始资料。

* > When James A. Mackay, a Scottish historian, published a biography of Alexander Graham Bell in 1998, Robert Bruce presented evidence that the book was largely plagiarized from his 1973 biography, which had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mackay  was forced to withdraw his book from the market. \(Incredibly, he did not learn from the experience because he then published  a biography of John Paul Jones, which was plagiarized from a 1942 book by Samuel Eliot Morison.\)

  苏格兰的历史学家James A. Mackay，在1998年出版了亚历山大·格雷厄姆传记，而Robert Bruce提出的证据表明，这本书大量抄袭了他曾获普利策奖的传记。Mackay被迫从市场撤回他的书。（令人难以置信的是，他没有这次经历中学到东西，因为他接着出版了约翰·保罗·琼斯的传记，这本书抄袭了samuel Eliot Morison 1942年写的书。）

* > When New York Times reporter Jason Blair was discovered to have plagiarized stories from other reporters and fabricated  quotations and details in his stories, he resigned his position in disgrace. Soon afterward, the two senior editors who had been  his closest mentors also resigned, reportedly because of their irresponsible handling of Blair’s reportage and the subsequent  scandal.

  纽约时报记者Jason Blair被发现抄袭其他记者的故事，并在故事中编造引文和细节，他在耻辱中辞职了。不久之后，两个高级编辑——曾是他最亲密的导师，也辞职了，据说是因为他们不负责任地处理Blair的报道和随后的丑闻。


> Some cases of plagiarism are attributable to intentional dishonesty, others to carelessness. But many, perhaps most, are due  to misunderstanding. The instructions “Base your paper on research rather than on your own unfounded opinions” and “Don’t  present other people’s ideas as your own” seem contradictory and may confuse students, especially if no clarification is  offered. Fortunately, there is a way to honor both instructions and, in the process, to avoid plagiarism.

有些抄袭的情况可归咎于故意不诚实，另一些则归咎于粗心大意。但是许多，也许是大多数，是因为不理解。“你的论文要在研究的基础上而不是你自己的无事实根据的观点”和“不要把其他人的想法作为自己的”的说明似乎矛盾，可能会使学生疑惑，特别是如果没有提供澄清。幸运的是，有一种方式来执行这两个指令，并在这个过程中，避免抄袭。

> Step 1: When you are  researching a topic, keep your sources’ ideas separate from your own. Begin by keeping a record of  each source of information you consult. For an Internet source, record the Web site address, the author and title of the item,  and the date you visited the site. For a book, record the author, title, place of publication, publisher, and date of publication.  For a magazine or journal article, record the author, title, the name of the publication, and its date of issue. For a TV or radio    broadcast, record the program title, station, and date of transmission.

第一步：**当你正在研究一个主题时，把你的原始资料的想法和你自己的分离。首先保留你查阅的每个信息来源的记录。**对于一个互联网来源，记录网站地址、项目的作者和标题、以及你访问网站的日期；对于一本书，记录作者、标题、出版地、出版商、出版日期；对于一本杂志或者期刊文章，记录作者、标题、出版物名称、和它的发行日期；对于一个电视或者无线电广播，记录节目名称，电台，播送日期。

> Step 2: As you read each source, note the ideas you want to refer to in your writing. If the author’s words are unusually clear  and concise, copy them exactly and put quotation marks around them. Otherwise, paraphrase— that is, restate the author’s  ideas in your own words. Write down the number\( s\) of the page\(s\) on which the author’s passage appears.

第二步：**当你读每个来源的时候，记录你想在写作中引用的想法。如果作者的话异常清晰和简洁，准确地复制它们，并在其周围加上引号。否则，改述——即用你自己的话重述作者的观点。写下作者的段落出现的页码。**

> If the author’s idea triggers a response in your mind—such as a question, a connection between this idea and something else  you’ve read, or an experience of your own that supports or challenges what the author says—write it down and put brackets  \(not parentheses\) around it so that you will be able to identify it as your own when you review your notes. Here is a sample research record illustrating these two steps:

**如果作者的想法触发了你的想法——比如一个问题、这个想法和你已经读到过的其他事物之间的联系、或者可以支持或者挑战作者所说的一次自身的经历——写下来并在其周围加上括号（不是圆括号）**，这样当你回顾你的笔记的时候你能够确定它是你自己的。这里是说明这两步的一个样本研究记录：

* > Adler, Mortimer J. The Great Ideas: A Lexicon of Western Thought \(New York: Macmillan, 1992\) Says that throughout the  ages, from ancient Greece,  philosophers have argued about whether various ideas are true. Says it’s remarkable that most  renowned thinkers have agreed about what truth is—”a correspondence between thought and reality.” 867 Also says that  Freud saw this as the scientific view of truth. Quotes Freud: “This correspondence with the real external world we call truth. It  is the aim of scientific work, even when the practical value of that work does not interest us.” 869 \[I say true statements fit the  facts; false statements do not.\]

* Adler, Mortimer J. 伟大想法： 西方思想词典（纽约：麦克米兰，1992）说，整个中世纪，在古希腊，哲学家们争论各种想法是否真实。 说大多数有名的思想者同意真理是——“思想与现实之间的对应”是不同寻常的。867还说弗洛伊德认为这是真理的科学观点。引用弗洛伊德：“这种与真实外部世界的对应关系，我们称之为真理。这是科学工作的目的，即使这项工作的实际价值不让我们感兴趣。” 869\[我说真实的陈述符合事实；虚假的陈述则不。\]


> Whenever you look back on this record, even a year from now, you will be able to tell at a glance which ideas and words are  the author’s and which are yours. The first three sentences are, with the exception of the directly quoted part, paraphrases of  the author’s ideas. Next is a direct quotation. The final sentence, in brackets, is your own idea.

每当你回顾这条记录，即使是一年之后，你依然能够一目了然地分辨出哪些想法或者句子是作者的，哪个是你的。前三句，除了直接引用的部分，改述了作者的想法。接着是一个直接的引用。最后的句子，在中括号里，是你自己的想法。

> Step 3: When you compose your paper, work borrowed ideas and words into your own writing by judicious use of quoting  and paraphrasing. In addition, give credit to the various authors. Your goal here is to eliminate all doubt about which ideas  and words belong to whom. In formal presentations, this crediting is done in footnotes; in informal ones, it is done simply by  mentioning the author’s name.

第三步：当你撰写论文时，通过合理地使用引号和改述，把借来的想法和文字写进自己的作品中。此外，给予不同作者赞扬。这里你的目标是消除所有对哪些想法和文字属于谁的怀疑。在正式的演讲中，这种赞扬可以在脚注中完成；在非正式的场合，这个可以通过简单地提及作者的名字来完成。

> Here is an example of how the material from Mortimer Adler might be worked into a composition. \(Note the form that is used  for the footnote.\) The second paragraph illustrates how your own idea might be expanded:

这里是一个例子，来自Mortimer Adler的材料可能怎样被写入到作文中。（注意形式是使用脚注）第二段说明你自己的想法可以如何被延伸。

* > Mortimer J. Adler explains that throughout the ages, from the time of the ancient Greeks, philosophers have argued about  whether various ideas are true. But to Adler the remarkable thing is that, even as they argued, most renowned thinkers have  agreed about what truth is. They saw it as “a correspondence between thought and reality.” Adler points  out that Sigmund  Freud believed this was also the scientific view of truth. He quotes Freud as follows: “This correspondence with the real external world we call truth. It is the aim of scientific work, even when the practical value of that work does not interest us.”\*

  Mortimer J.Adler 解释说，整个中世纪，在古希腊，哲学家们争论各种想法是否真实。但是对于Alder来说不同寻常的是，即使他们争论，大多数有名的思想者已经同意什么是真理。他们把这个说成是“一种想法和显示之间的对应关系。”Alder指出弗洛伊德认为这也是真理的科学观点。他引用了弗洛伊德如下 ：“这种与真实外部世界之间的对应关系，我们称之为真实。这是科学工作的目的，即使这项工作的实际价值不让我们感兴趣。”

* > This correspondence view of truth is consistent with the commonsense rule that a statement is true if it fits the facts and false  if it does not. For example, the statement “The twin towers of New York’s World Trade Center were destroyed on September  11, 2002,” is false because they were destroyed the previous year. I may sincerely believe that it is true, but my believing in  no way affects the truth of the matter. In much the same way, if an innocent man is convicted of a crime, neither the court’s  decision nor the world’s acceptance of it will make him any less innocent. We may be free to think what we wish, but our thinking can’t alter reality.

  这种对应的真理观符合常识规则——如果观点符合事实则它是真的，如果观点不符合事实则它是假的。例如，“纽约的世界贸易中心的双塔在2002年9月11日被摧毁”的说法是错的，因为它们在前一年被摧毁了。我可能真诚地相信这是真的，但是我的信任不会影响这件事的真相。以同样的方式，如果一个无辜的人被判有罪，无论是法院的决定还是它的世界接受度都不会使他更加无辜。我们可以自由地想想我们的愿望，但我们的想法不能改变现实。
