> Once ideas are put into words and published, they become intellectual property, and the author has the same rights over them  as he or she has over a material possession such as a house or a car. The only real difference is that intellectual property is  purchased with mental effort rather than money. Anyone who has ever wracked his or her brain trying to solve a problem or  trying to put an idea into clear and meaningful words can appreciate how difficult mental effort can be.

一旦想法变成了文字并发表，它就成为了知识财产，作者对它们拥有权利，就像他\/她对房屋和汽车等物质财产拥有权利。唯一真正的区别是知识财产是用精神上的努力而不是金钱购买的。任何曾经破坏他\/她的大脑，试图解决一个问题，或者试图把一个想法变成清晰并有意义的文字的人，会领会到精神上的努力是多么困难。

> Plagiarism is passing off other people’s ideas or words as one’s own. It is doubly offensive in that it both steals and deceives.  In the academic world, plagiarism is considered an ethical violation and is punished by a failing grade for a paper or a course  or even by dismissal from the institution. Outside the academy, it is a crime that can be prosecuted if the person to whom the  ideas and words belong wishes to bring charges. Either way, the offender suffers dishonor and disgrace, as the following  examples illustrate:

抄袭是把别人的想法或者文字当作自己的。它是双重无礼的，因为它既偷窃又欺骗。在学术界，抄袭被认为是违反道德的行为，会受到一篇论文或课程的不及格分数的惩罚，甚至被解雇。在学术之外，如果想法和文字的拥有者想要提出指控，这是一种可以被起诉起诉的罪行。无论哪种方式，冒犯者都会遭受侮辱，如下面的例子所示：

* > When a university in South Africa learned that professor Marks Chabel had plagiarized most of his doctoral dissertation from Kimberly Lanegran of the University of Florida, the university fired Chabel. Moreover, the university that had awarded him his  Ph.D. revoked it.

  当南非的一所大学得知教授Marks Chabel的博士论文大多数抄袭自佛罗里达大学的Kimberly Lanegran， 大学解雇了Chabel。另外大学撤销了授予他的博士学位。

* > When U.S. Senator Joseph Biden was seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, it was revealed that he had  plagiarized passages from speeches by British politician Neil Kinnock and by Robert Kennedy. It was also learned that, while in  law school, he had plagiarized a number of pages from a legal article. The ensuing scandal led Biden to withdraw his andidacy  and has continued to stain his reputation. The reputation of historian Stephen Ambrose was tarnished by allegations that over  the years he plagiarized the work of several authors. Doris Kearns Goodwin, historian and advisor to President Lyndon Johnson, suffered a similar embarrassment when she was discovered to have plagiarized from more than one source in one of  her books.

  当美国参议员Joseph Biden正在寻求1988民主党总统候选人提名时，他曾经抄袭了英国政客Neil Kinnock和Robert Kennedy的演讲段落被揭露。还得知，在法学院期间，他从一个法律的文章中抄袭了好几页。随后的丑闻导致Biden撤回候选人资格，并继续玷污他的名声。历史学家Stephen Ambrose的名声被指控多年来他抄袭几个作者的作品败坏。Doris Kearns Goodwin，历史学家和总统Lyndon的顾问，遭受了类似的尴尬，当她被发现她的一本书中抄袭了多个原始资料。

* When James A. Mackay, a Scottish historian, published a biography of Alexander Graham Bell in 1998, Robert Bruce presented evidence that the book was largely plagiarized from his 1973 biography, which had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mackay  was forced to withdraw his book from the market. \(Incredibly, he did not learn from the experience because he then published  a biography of John Paul Jones, which was plagiarized from a 1942 book by Samuel Eliot Morison.\) 

*  When New York Times reporter Jason Blair was discovered to have plagiarized stories from other reporters and fabricated  quotations and details in his stories, he resigned his position in disgrace. Soon afterward, the two senior editors who had been  his closest mentors also resigned, reportedly because of their irresponsible handling of Blair’s reportage and the subsequent  scandal.
