> At its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem solving and decision making. At its worst, it frays nerves, creates animosity,and leaves important issues unresolved. Unfortunately, the most prominent models for discussion in contemporary culture—radio and TV talk shows—often produce the latter effects.

 在最好的情况下，讨论可以加深理解，促进问题解决和决策制定。在最坏的情况下，它使神经紧张，创造敌意，让重要问题没有得到解决。不幸的是，在当代文化中，最著名的讨论模型——无线电广播和电视脱口秀——通常产生后一种结果。

> Many hosts demand that their guests answer complex questions with simple “yes” or “no” answers. If the guests respond that way, they are attacked for oversimplifying. If, instead, they try to offer a balanced answer,the host shouts, “You’re not answering the question,” and proceeds to answer it himself. Guests who agree with the host are treated warmly; others are dismissed as ignorant or dishonest. Often as not, when two guests are debating, each takes a turn interrupting while the other shouts, “Let me finish.” Neither shows any desire to learn from the other. Typically, as the show draws to a close, the host thanks the participants for a “vigorous debate” and promises the audience more of the same next time.

许多主持人要求他们的嘉宾用简单的“是”或者“否”回答复杂的问题。如果嘉宾用这种方式回应，他们会因过于简单而被攻击。如果，取而代之，他们试图提供一个平衡的答案，主持人大喊，“你没有在回答问题，”并继续自己来回答。同意主持人的嘉宾被热情地对待；其他人则被视为矇昧或不诚实。通常情况下，当两个嘉宾正在辩论，每个人轮流打断，而另外一个则喊着，“让我说完。”两个都没有表现出任何想从对方学习的意愿。典型地，随着节目结束，主持人感谢参与者“有力的辩论”并向观众保证下一次更精彩。

> Here are some simple guidelines for ensuring that the discussions you engage in—in the classroom, on the job, or at home—are more civil,meaningful, and productive than what you see on TV. By following these guidelines, you will set a good example for the people around you.

以下是一些简单的指南，确保你在教室、工作中、或者家中加入的讨论，比你在电视上看到的更加民主、有意义和高产。通过遵守这些指南，你将为你周围的人树立一个好榜样。

> **Whenever possible, prepare in advance.** Not every discussion can be prepared for in advance, but many can. An agenda is usually circulated several days before a business or committee meeting. In college courses, the assignment schedule provides a reliable indication of what will be discussed in class on a given day. Use this information to prepare: Begin by reflecting on what you already know about the topic. Then decide how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.\(Fifteen or twenty minutes of focused searching in the library or on the Internet can produce a significant amount of information on almost any subject.\) Try to anticipate the different points of view that might be expressed in the discussion and consider the relative merits of each. Keep your conclusions tentative at this point, so that you will be open to the facts and interpretations others will present.

**尽可能提前做准备。**不是每个讨论都可以提前准备，但是许多都可以。议程通常在商业或者委员会会议前几天分发。在大学课程中，任务一览表提供了在某一天在课堂中将讨论什么的可靠指示。使用这些信息准备：首先反思你对话题已知什么。然后确定你可以怎样扩展你的知识并花时间去那样做。（在图书馆或者互联网上，十五或二十分钟的专注搜索可以在几乎任何主题上产生有意义的大量信息。）试着预料在讨论中可能会被表达的不同观点，考虑每个相应的价值。此时保持你的结论暂定，以便你对其他人可能展示的事实和解释开放。

> **Set reasonable expectations.** Have you ever left a discussion disappointed that others hadn’t abandoned their views and embraced yours? Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked you what evidence you had to support your opinion? If the answer to either question is yes, you probably expect too much of others. People seldom change their minds easily or quickly, particularly in the case of long-held convictions. And when they encounter ideas that differ from their own, they naturally want to know what evidence supports those ideas. Expect to have your ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.

**设置合理的期望。**你有没有留下一个讨论失望，其他人不放弃他们的观点并接受你的？你有没有感到生气，当一些人不同意你或者问你有什么证据支撑你的观点的时候？如果两个问题答案都是肯定的，你可能对其他人期望太多了。人们几乎不轻易或快速地改变他们的主意，特别是在长期持有的信念的情况下。当他们遇见和自己不同的想法时，他们自然想知道什么证据支撑了这些想法。等待你的想法被质疑，并乐于回应。

> **Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.** To be productive,discussion requires an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility. Egotism produces disrespectful attitudes toward others—notably, “I’m more important than other people,” “My ideas are better than anyone else’s,” and“Rules don’t apply to me.” Personal agendas, such as dislike for another participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal attacks and unwillingness to listen to others’ views.

**把自我为中心和个人议程留在门口。**为了富有成效，讨论需要一个互相尊重并且礼貌的氛围。自我为中心产生对他人不尊重的态度——尤其，“我比其他人重要”，“我的主意比任何人的好”，以及“规则不适用于我。”个人的议程，如不喜欢另一个参与者或者对一个观点过分地热情，会导致个人攻击和不愿意听取他人的观点。

> **Contribute but don’t dominate.** If you are the kind of person who loves to talk and has a lot to say, you probably contribute more to discussions than other participants. On the other hand, if you are more reserved, you may seldom say anything. There is nothing wrong with being either kind of person. However, discussions tend to be most productive when everyone contributes ideas. For this to happen, loquacious people need to exercise a little restraint, and more reserved people need to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts.

**贡献但不主宰。**如果你那种喜欢讨论并有很多话讲的人，你可能比其他参与者对讨论贡献更多。另一方面，如果你更矜持点你可能很少说话。成为任何一种人都没有错。然而，当每个人贡献想法的时候，讨论往往是最富有成效的。为了实现这点，健谈的人需要保持一点克制，更矜持点人需要承担分享他们想法的责任。

> **Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.** Such mannerisms include starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or slurring your words; and punctuating every phrase or clause with audible pauses \(“um,” “ah,”\) or meaningless expressions \(“like,” “you know,”“man”\). These annoying mannerisms distract people from your message. To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape your conversations with friends and family \(with their permission\), then play the tape back and listen to yourself. Whenever you are engaged in a discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.

**避免让人分心的演讲习惯。**这些习惯包括开始一个句子，接着突然地转到另一个句子；咕哝或含糊不清你的话；不时中断每个词组或用听得见的暂停（“呃”，“啊”）分句或者无意义的措辞（“就像”，“你知道”，“朋友”）。这些恼人的习惯转移人们对你信息的注意力。为了克服它们，当你说话的时候听你自己说。更好的是，把你和朋友、家人的谈话录到磁带上（经过他们的允许），然后回放磁带听你自己。每当你加入一个讨论时，旨在表达清晰、直截了当、节约。

> **Listen actively.** When the participants don’t listen to one another,discussion becomes little more than serial monologue—each person taking a turn at speaking while the rest ignore what is being said. This can happen quite unintentionally because the mind can process ideas faster than the fastest speaker can deliver them. Your mind may get tired of waiting and wander about aimlessly like a dog off its leash. In such cases,instead of listening to the speaker’s words, you may think about her clothing or hairstyle or look outside the window and observe what ishappening there. Even when you make a serious effort to listen, it is easy to lose focus. If the speaker’s words trigger an unrelated memory, you may slip away to that earlier time and place. If the speaker says something you disagree with, you may begin framing a reply. The best way to maintain your attention is to be alert for such distractions and to resist them. Strive to enter the speaker’s frame of mind, understand what is said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realizeyour mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.

**积极地倾听。**当参与者不互相倾听时，讨论变成仅仅是一连串的独角戏——每个人轮流说话，而剩下的人无视正在说的话。这个可能会完全无意地发生，因为思维可以比最快的发言者更快地处理想法。你的思维可能疲于等待并且像一只脱离了皮带的狗一样无目的地游荡。在这种情况下，你可能思考她的衣服或发型，或看向窗外并观察那里正在发生什么，而不是倾听说话者的话。即使当你认真努力倾听，也很容易失去焦点。如果说话者的话引起了一个不相关的记忆，你可能会滑到那个早期的时间和地点。如果说话者说了一些你不同意的事，你可能开始制定一个答复。维持你注意力最好的方式是警惕这些分心之事并抵制他们。争取进入说话者的思维框架，理解他正在说什么，并与之前所说的联系起来。每当你意识到你的思维正在游荡，把它拖回到任务上。

> **Judge ideas responsibly.** Ideas range in quality from profound to ridiculous, helpful to harmful, ennobling to degrading. It is therefore appropriate to pass judgment on them. However, fairness demands that you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings. Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliar or different from your own because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a fair hearing.

**负责地评判想法。**想法的质量范围从深刻到荒谬，从有益到有害，从高尚到可耻。因此对想法作出评判是合适的。然而，公平性要求你的判断是基于对想法总体优点和缺点的深思熟虑，而不是基于初步的印象或者感觉。对不熟悉或者与你自身的不同的想法要特别小心，因为这些是你最倾向于拒绝公平倾听的想法。

> **Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.** No doubt you understand that shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do you realize that in many cases they are also a sign of intellectual insecurity? It’s true. If you really believe your ideas are sound, you will have no need to raise your voice or to silence the other person. Even if the other person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence and character is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree without being disagreeable.

**抵抗嚷嚷或打断的冲动。**毫无疑问，你明白嚷嚷和打断是粗鲁和无礼的行为，但你是否意识到许多情况下它们是**智力不安的信号**。这是真的。如果你真的相信你的想法是合理的，你不需要去提高你的音量或使其他人沉默。即使其他人斥诸于这种行为，证明信心和人格的最好方式是拒绝回应。使之成为你不同意却不令人讨厌的规则。
