> A number of misconceptions exist about critical thinking. One is that being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker. Virtually everyone has reasons, however weak they may be. The test of critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.

关于理性思维存在大量的误解。一个是能够用利用支撑信念使某人成为一个理性思维者。实际上每个人都有理由，然而这些理由可能是不可靠的。理性思维的测试是理由是否是好的并且有效的。

> Another misconception is that critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action. If that were the case, then every eccentric would be acritical thinker. Critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless of how common or uncommon those decisions are.

另一个误解是理性思维者从不模仿其他人的想法活着行为。如果真是那种情况，则每一个怪人将是理性思维者。理性思维意味着做合理的决定，无视这些决定是多么普遍活着不普遍。

> It is also a misconception that critical thinking is synonymous with having a lot of right answers in one’s head. There’s nothing wrong with having right answers, of course. But critical thinking involves the process of finding answers when they are not so readily available.

还有一个误解是理性思维者与某人脑中有许多正确的答案同义。当然，有正确的答案并没有错。但是理性思维涉及当答案没有如此容易地可获得时，去发现答案的过程。

> And yet another misconception is that critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either has it or does not. On the contrary, critical thinking is a matter of habit. The most careless, sloppy thinker can become a critical thinker by developing the characteristics of a critical thinker. This is not to say that all people have equal thinking potential but rather that everyone can achieve dramatic improvement.

同时还有另一个误解是理性思维不能被学习，一个人或者有理性思维，或者就没有。相反，理性思维是一个习惯问题。最粗心马虎的思考者也可以通过培养理性思维者的特征，成为一个理性思维者。这并不是说所有人有相等的思考潜力，而是所有人都可以实现戏剧性的改善。

> We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers—skill in asking appropriate questions. Another is control of one’s mental activities. John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us care to admit is spent “trifling with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.”7 Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious drift of images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter,examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, inother words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their minds actively as well as passively.

我们已经注意到理性思维者的一个特征——问适当的问题的能力。另一个是控制自己的精神活动。 John Dewey 曾经发现，更多的是我们的时间而不是我们大多数人愿意承认的时间，被花费在“摆弄精神图片，随机的回忆，愉快却无根据的希望，频繁变化，半发达的印象。”优秀的西靠着也不例外。然而，他们已经学会了比差劲的思考者更好，当他们想要时，如何阻止那个随意的、半清醒的图像漂流，如何修理他们的精神在一个特定的问题上，小心地检查它，对它形成一个判断。换句话说，他们已经学会如何接管他们的思维，主动和被动地使用他们的精神。

> Here are some additional characteristics of critical thinkers, as contrasted with those of uncritical thinkers:

这里是理性思维者的一些额外特征，作为与那些非理性思维者的对照：

| **Critical Thinkers . . .Uncritical Thinkers . . .** |  |
| --- | --- |
| Are honest with themselves, acknowledging what they don’t know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors. | Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations, and assume their views are error-free. |
| Regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges. | Regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances |
| Strive for understanding, keep curiosity alive, remain patient with complexity, and are ready to invest time to overcome confusion. | Are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain confused than make the effort to understand. |
| Base judgments on evidence rather than personal preferences, deferring judgment whenever evidence is insufficient. They revise judgments when new evidence reveals error. | Base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. |
| Are interested in other people’s ideas and so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person. | Are preoccupied with them- selves and their own opinions and so are unwilling to pay attention to others’ views. At the first sign of disagreement, they tend to think, “How can I refute this?” |
| Recognize that extreme views \(whether conservative or liberal\) are seldom correct, | Ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that support their established views. |
| Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting. | Tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively. |



| **理性思维者非理性思维者** |  |
| --- | --- |
| 对他们自己诚实，承认自己不知道，认识到自己的局限性，警惕自己的错误。 | 假装自己知道，忽视自己的局限性，假定他们的观点是无错的。 |
| 把困难和有争议的问题视为令人激动的挑战。 | 把困难和有争议的问题视为麻烦事。 |
| 争取理解，保持好奇心，对复杂性保持耐心，准备投入时间克服困惑。 | 对复杂性没有耐心，因此宁愿保留疑惑也不愿努力去理解。 |
| 基于证据判断而不是个人的偏好，每当证据无效时，推迟判断。当新的证据暴露了错误，他们校正判断。 | 基于第一印象和本能反应判断 |
| 对其他人的想法感兴趣，因此即使当他们倾向于反对他们的时候，也愿意去专心地阅读和听取，。 | 对他们自己和自己的观点专心致志，因此不愿意注意其他人的观点。分歧的第一信号，他们倾向于想，“我怎么能拒绝它呢？” |
| 认识到极端的看法（不论是保守的还是自由的）几乎不正确 | 忽视平衡的需要，并优先支持他们既定观点的意见。 |
| 练习克制，控制他们的感觉而不是被感觉控制，并在行动前思考。 | 倾向于跟随它们的感觉并且冲动地行动。 |

> As the desirable qualities suggest, critical thinking depends on mental discipline. Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and with hold their endorsement of any idea—even their own—until they have tested and confirmed it. John Dewey equated this mental discipline with freedom. That is, he argued that people who do not have it are not free persons but slaves to whim or circumstance:

作为理想的品质建议，理性思维取决于精神的自律。有效的思想者控制他们的精神活动，指导他们的想法而不是被想法指导，保持他们对任何观点的认可——即使是他们自己的观点——直到他们测试并证实那个观点。 John Dewey 将这种精神的自律和自由等同。也就是说，他认为没有拥有它的人不是自由的人，而是冲动或情况的奴隶。

* > If a man’s actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, then they are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or the circumstances of the moment. To cultivate unhindered, unreflective external activity is to foster enslavement, for it leaves the person at the mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance.8

  如果一个人的行动不是由经过缜密思考的结论指导，则他们被不明智的冲动、不平衡的欲望、突发奇想、或者当时的情况所指导。培养不受阻碍的、鲁莽的外部活动是在培养奴役，它听任人受欲望、感觉和环境的摆布。
