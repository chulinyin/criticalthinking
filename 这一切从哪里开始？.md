> The idea of creating our own truth without outside influence or assistance may sound reasonable if we focus only on our adulthood. The moment we consider our childhood, however, the idea becomes suspect, because in childhood we were all dependent in every sense: physically,emotionally, and intellectually. What we knew and believed about everything was what others told us. We asked questions—”Why, Mommy?”“Why, Daddy?” Our parents answered them. We accepted those answers and made them the foundation of our belief system, no matter how elaborate it would become in adulthood.

如果我们仅专注于我们的成年期，我们是在没有外界影响或者帮助下创造了自己的真理的观点可能是合理。然而，我们考虑我们的童年时期时，这个观点变得不可信，因为在童年时期，我们都依赖于每一种感觉：身体上、情感上和智力上。我们所知道和相信的任何东西都是其他人告诉我们的。我们问——“为什么，妈妈？”“为什么，爸爸？”父母回答了它们。我们接受了这些答案，并使之成为我们信念系统的基石，不论它在成年后变得多么复杂。

> Relativists could, of course, claim that we leave all those early influences behind when we reach adulthood, but that denies the most fundamental principles of psychology. Here is how one writer explained the continuing influence of childhood experience:

当然，相对主义者可能宣称，当我们成年时，我们丢弃了所有这些早期影响。但是这拒绝了心理学的最基本原则。这里是一个作者如何解释童年经历的持续影响。

* > We are told about the world before we see it. We imagine most things before we experience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception. They mark out certain objects as familiar or strange, emphasizing the difference, so that the slightly familiar is seen as very familiar, and the somewhat strange as sharply alien. They are aroused by small signs, which may vary from a true index to a vague analogy. Aroused, they flood fresh vision with older images, and project into the world what has been resurrected in memory.1

  我们被告知世界，在我们看到它之前。我们想象大多数东西，在我们经历它们之前。除非教育已经让我们敏锐地意识到这些先入之见，并深入地治理这个那个感知过程。他们将某些东西标记为熟悉或者陌生，强调了差异，使稍微熟悉的被视为非常熟悉，使有点陌生的被视为鲜明的外星人。它们被小迹象唤醒，这可能从一个真实的索引到一个模糊的推理。唤醒，他们用旧的图像充满新鲜的视觉，并投射到已经在记忆中恢复的世界里。


> You have heard the old saying seeing is believing. The reverse— believing is seeing—is equally correct. To a greater or lesser extent, what we regard as our unique perspective bears the imprint of other people’s ideas and beliefs.

你听过一句老话——眼见为实。相反，所信为所见是同样正确的。我们所认为的自己的独特视角，或多或少带有其他人的观点和信念的印记。
