> Opinion can be corrupted by any one of four broad kinds of errors.\* These classifications, with examples added for clarification, are the following:

观点可以被始终广泛错误中的任何一种损坏。\*这些为了澄清添加了例子的分类如下：

1. > Errors or tendencies to error common among all people by virtue of their being human \(for example, the tendency to perceive selectively or rush to judgment or oversimplify complex realities\)

   由于人性的美德，错误或错误倾向在所有人之中是普遍的（例如，倾向于选择性感知或者急于判断或者过度简化复杂现实）

2. > Errors or tendencies to error associated with one’s individual habits of mind or personal attitudes, beliefs, or theories \(for example, the habit of thinking the worst of members of a race or religion against which one harbors prejudice\)

   与个人思维习惯或者个人态度、信仰或者学说有关的错误或错误倾向。（例如，思考种族或者宗教的最坏成员而对一个人怀有偏见的习惯）

3. > Errors that come from human communication and the limitations of language \(for example, the practice of expressing a thought or feeling inadequately and leading others to form a mistaken impression\)

   来自人类交流以及语言限制的错误。（例如，表达一个想法或感觉不充分，导致他人形成了一个错误印象的做法。）

4. > Errors in the general fashion of an age \(for example, the tendency in our grandparents’ day to accept authority unquestioningly or the tendency in ours to recognize no authority but oneself \)

   一个时代的普遍潮流中的错误。（例如，在我们的祖父一代，倾向于不加质疑地接受权威，而在我们一代，倾向于无视权威只认自己。）

> Some people, of course, are more prone to errors than others. English philosopher John Locke observed that these people fall into three groups:

当然，一些人比其他人更容易犯错。英国哲学家 John Locke 发现这些人分为三种：

* > Those who seldom reason at all, but think and act as those around them do—parents, neighbors, the clergy, or anyone else they admire and respect. Such people want to avoid the difficulty that accompanies thinking for themselves.

  那些几乎不推理的人，`但想得或者表现得好像周围人的人推理了`——父母、邻居、神职人员或者任何他们崇拜和尊重的人。`这类人想要避免伴随而来为他们自己思考的困难。`

* > Those who are determined to let passion rather than reason govern their lives. Those people are influenced only by reasoning that supports their prejudices.

  那些决心让激情而不是理性支配他们生活的人。这些人仅受到支持他们偏见的推理的影响。

* > Those who sincerely follow reason, but lack sound, overall good sense, and so do not look at all sides of an issue. They tend to talk with one type of person, read one type of book, and so are exposed to only one viewpoint.13

  那些真诚地追随理性，但是缺乏健全、整体良好意识的人，因此不能看到问题的各个方面。他们倾向于与一种类型的人交谈，读一种类型的书，因此只暴露一个观点。

> To Locke’s list we should add one more type: those who never bother to reexamine an opinion once it has been formed. These people are often the most error prone of all, for they forfeit all opportunity to correct mistakenopinions when new evidence arises.

对于 Locke 的名单，我们应该再添加一个类型：那些一旦一个观点已经形成，便从不费心重新检查的人。这些人通常是所有人中最容易犯错的，因为当新的证据出现的时，他们丧失了所有纠正错误观点的机会。
