> Following are some items of “common knowledge.” Determine how many you already know, and then decide, if possible, how you came to know each. Complete this informal inventory before continuing with the chapter.

下面是一些“常识”的项目。确定你已知多少，接着决定，如果可能的话，你会如何去知道每个项目。在继续本章之前，请先完成这个非正式的目录。

1. > Women are nurturing but men are not.

   `女人正在培养教育，但男人却没有`。

2. > African Americans had little or no part in settling the American West.

   非洲裔美国人少部分人或者没有人居住在美国西部。

3. > Expressing anger has the effect of reducing it and making us feel better.

   表达愤怒有减少它和使我们感觉更好的效果。

4. > The Puritans were “prim, proper, and prudish prigs.”

   清教徒是古板的、得体的、拘谨的、一本正经的人。

5. > Before Columbus arrived in the New World, Native Americans lived in peace with one another and in respectful harmony with the environment.

   在哥伦布到达新世界之前，美洲土著彼此和平相处，并与环境和谐相处

6. > .Alfred Kinsey’s research on human sexuality is scrupulously scholarly and objective.

   Alfred Kinsey 在人类性行为上的研究是严谨、学术并且客观的。

7. > Employers import unskilled labor from other countries to save money.

   雇主从其他国家进口非熟练劳动力以节省资金。

8. > The practice of slavery originated in colonial America.

   奴隶制起源于殖民地美国。

> It would be surprising if you did not think you knew most of these items. After all, many writers have written about them, and they are widely accepted as conventional wisdom. But let’s look a little more closely at each of them.

如果你认为你不知道这些项目的大部分，这将令人吃惊。毕竟，许多作家写过它们，它们被作为生活常识广泛地接受。但是让我们更仔细一点地看它们每一个。

1. > Barbara Risman became curious about this idea and decided to study it further. Her findings challenged the conventional wisdom. Apparently, men who are responsible for caring for children or elderly parents display the same nurturing traits usually associated with women. She concluded that these traits are as dependent on one’s role in life as on one’s sex. 1

   Barbara Risman 开始对这个观点好奇，决定进一步研究它。她的研究结果挑战了生活常识。显然，负责照顾小孩或者年迈父母的男性展现了通常与女人相关的相同培养特性，。她推断这些特性依赖于一个人在生活中的角色和一个人的性别。

2. > The facts contradict what is known. For example, 25 percent of the cowboys in Texas cattle drives were African American, as were 60 percent of original settlers of Los Angeles.2 The reason these facts are not more widely known is probably because of scholarly omission of information about African Americans from the history books.

   事实与已知矛盾。例如，在得克萨斯州的赶牛者中 25% 的牛仔是非洲裔美国人，60% 是洛杉矶原居民。这些事实没有广为人知可能是由于`对非洲裔美国人历史的书籍信息的学术疏漏`。

3. > Conventional wisdom again is wrong. After reviewing the evidence about anger, Carol Tavris concludes, “The psychological rationales for ventilating anger do not stand up under experimental scrutiny. The weight of the evidence indicates precisely the opposite: expressing anger makes you angrier, solidifies an angry attitude, and establishes a hostile habit. If you keep quiet about momentary irritations and distract yourself with pleasant activity until your fury simmers down, chances are you will feel better, and feel better faster, than if you let yourself go in a shouting match.”3

   生活常识又错了。在回顾关于愤怒的证据之后，Carol Tavris 总结道，“公开表达愤怒的心理学逻辑依据在实验审查下是站不住脚的。`证据的分量`表明恰恰相反：表达愤怒只会让你更加愤怒，巩固愤怒的态度，并建立一个敌对的习惯。如果你对一时的恼怒保持安静，并用愉快的活动转移注意力直到你的愤怒消退可能会让你感觉更好些，并且这比你让自己去对骂好得更快。”

4. > Although the Puritans did hold that sex is rightly reserved for marriage, they did not hesitate to talk openly about the subject and were not prudish within marriage. The problem seems to be that people confuse the Puritans with the Victorians. 4

   尽管清教徒确实认为性爱理所当然地为结婚保留，但是他们毫不犹豫地公开谈论这个问题，并且不会在婚内拘谨。问题看起来是人们混淆了清教徒和维多利亚女王时代的人，

5. > This is pure myth. Few tribes were completely peaceful, and many not only were warlike but slaughtered women and children and tortured their captives. Some tribes also offered human sacrifices, murdered the elderly, and practiced cannibalism. As to their alleged harmonious respect for nature, many tribes deforested the land and want only killed whole herds of animals.5

   这纯粹是神话故事。几乎没有部落是完全和平的，许多部落不仅好战，还屠杀妇孺，折磨俘虏。一些部落还提供人类献祭，杀害老人，练习自相残杀。至于他们所谓的和谐尊敬自然，许多部落砍伐陆地的森林并只想要杀死成群的动物。

6. > Alfred Kinsey’s work on human sexuality has been regarded as objective, scholarly, and definitive for more than half a century. In fact, it has become a foundation of psychotherapy, education, and even religion. Amazingly, in all that time no one read it critically until Judith A. Reisman and Edward W. Eichel did so. They document that Kinsey approached his work with a firm bias that significantly influenced his conclusions. He sought to establish that exclusive heterosexuality is abnormal and results merely from conditioning and inhibition; that sex between a man and a woman is no more natural than sex between two men, two women, a man and a child, or a man and an animal; and that bisexuality should be considered the norm for human sexuality. When Abraham Maslow demonstrated to Kinsey that his approach was unscientific, Kinsey simply ignored him. Kinsey went on to assert that incest can be satisfying and enriching and that children are upset by adult sexual advances solely because of the prudishness of parents and legal authorities. The authors also allege that in his research Kinsey employed a group of nine sex offenders to manually and orally stimulate to orgasm several hundred infants and children.6

   半个多世纪以来，Alfred Kinsey在人类性行为上的作品一直被认为是客观、学术以及最权威的。事实上，它已经成为心理治疗、教育甚至宗教的基础。令人惊奇的是，这么长时间以来，直到 Judith A. Reisman 和 Edward W. Eichel 之前，一直都没有人批判性地读过（这些作品）。他两用文件证明了 Kinsey 以坚定的偏见处理了他的作品，而这显著影响了他的结论。他试图建立：排他的异性恋是反常的，并且仅是调节和抑制的结果；男&女之间的性爱不再比男&男、女&女、男&童或者男&动物更正；双性恋应该被认为是人类性行为的常态。当 Abraham Maslow 向 Kinsey 证明他的方法不科学的时候，Kinsey 完全不理会他。Kinsey 继续主张乱伦可以令人满意并且充实，由于父母和法律部门的假正经，`孩子们完全对成年人的性发展感到苦恼`。作家们还声称在 Kinsey 的研究中，他雇用了9名性侵罪犯用手或者口刺激几百个婴儿和儿童，使之达到性高潮。

7. > The fact is that in many cases imported labor costs more money than domestic labor when the cost of transporting the workers is included in the calculation. For example, Indian workers were chosen over local Africans to build a railroad in East Africa. Similarly, Chinese workers were chosen over colonial Malayans. In both cases, the total cost of using imported workers was greater, but the cost per unit of work was lower because the imported workers produced more. In these and many other cases, the principal reason for choosing foreign over domestic labor is that the foreign workers are “more diligent, reliable,skilled, or careful.”7

   事实是在许多情况下，当运输工人的成本被计算在内时，（雇佣）进口劳动力要比（雇佣）国内劳动力花更多的钱。例如，印度工人被本地非洲人选中来建造东非的铁路。类似的，中国工人被殖民地的马来人选中。在这两种情况中，使用进口劳动力的总成本更高，但是单位工作成本更低，因为进口的工人产出更多。在这些和许多其他情况下，选择外国而不是本国工人的原因是外国工人更加“勤奋、可靠、熟练或者小心。”

8. > This notion is also mistaken. Slavery is thousands of years old, predating Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. It was practiced by the Venetians, Greeks, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians, amongothers. Native American tribes enslaved one another long before the time of Columbus. The distinction enjoyed by the Americas is not having introduced slavery, but having abolished it. Slavery was abolished in the Western Hemisphere many decades before it was in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.8

   这个概念也是错误的。奴隶制已经有数千年历史了，早于伊斯兰教、佛教和基督教。它通过威尼斯人、希腊人、犹太人、中国人、印度人和埃及人被实践。印第安部落在哥伦布时期前相互奴役。美洲人享有的区别不是推行了奴隶制，而是废除了它。奴隶制在西半球比在非洲、亚洲和中东早十几年取消。

> The more of the eight items you “knew,” and the surer you were of your “knowledge,” the more troubling you are likely to find these facts. You may,in fact, be thinking, “Wait a minute, there must be some mistake. Who are these people Ruggiero is quoting? Are they genuine scholars? I’m skeptical of the whole lot of them.” This reaction is understandable, because familiarity with a false statement can make it seem true. Yet it is a reaction critical thinkers keep on a short leash. The ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus’s warning is relevant: “Get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.”

这八个项目你“知道”得越多，你对你的“知识”越确信，很可能你发现这些事实就越费力。事实上，你可能在想，“等等，肯定有一些错了。这些人正在引用谁的话？他们是真正的学者吗？我对他们中的很多人都持怀疑态度。”这个反应是可以理解的，因为对错误陈述的熟悉可以使它看上去是真的。然而，这是理性思考者严格限制自己的反应。古希腊哲学家爱比克泰德的警告是相关的：“摆脱自负。因为任何人都不可能开始学习他认为他已经知道的东西。”

> Are you still troubled by our debunking of the conventional wisdom?Then consider that, for centuries, conventional wisdom also held that heavier objects fall more rapidly than lighter ones and that the heart and not the brain is the seat of consciousness. 9 It also rejected the idea that machines could ever fly, enable people to communicate with one another across town, or create pictures of the interior of the human body. That such “wisdom” is really shortsightedness is plain to us only because some individuals were willing to ask, Is it possible that what I and other people think we know isn’t really so? This little question is one of the most useful tools in critical thinking.

你仍然困扰于我们对生活常识的揭穿？那么请考虑，几个世纪以来，生活常识还认为重的物体比轻的物体掉落得更快；心脏是意识的所在地，而不是大脑。它还拒绝机器能飞，能让人穿越城镇和别人交流，或者能创造人体内部的图像等想法。这种“常识”对我们来说显然是真正的目光短浅，仅仅因为有些人会乐意问，我和其他人认为我们知道的东西是否可能并不是真的这样？这个小问题是理性思维中最有用的工具之一。
