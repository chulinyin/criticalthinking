# First Chapter

Anyone who wishes to master an activity must first understand its

tools and rules. This is as true of critical thinking as it is of golf, carpentry,

flying a plane, or brain surgery. In critical thinking, however, the

tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern

mental rather than physical performance.



This first section explores seven important concepts—individuality,

critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument—

with a chapter devoted to each. Most of these concepts are so familiar

that you may be inclined to wonder whether there is any point to examining

them. The answer is yes, for three reasons. First, much of what

is commonly believed about these concepts is mistaken. Second, who

ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights.

Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the more

proficient you will be in your thinking.
