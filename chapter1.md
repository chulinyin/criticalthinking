> Anyone who wishes to master an activity must first understand its tools and rules. This is as true of critical thinking as it is of golf, carpentry, flying a plane, or brain surgery. In critical thinking, however, the tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern mental rather than physical performance.

任何人希望**精通一项活动都必须先了解它的工具和规则**。这对理性思维来说是真的，对高尔夫、木工、开飞机、脑外科手术来说也是真的。然而**对于理性思维**，**工具不是物质对象而是概念**，**规则管理精神而不是物理的性能**。（在管理精神的规则下，使用概念去理性思维。）

> This first section explores seven important concepts—individuality, critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument—with a chapter devoted to each. Most of these concepts are so familiar that you may be inclined to wonder whether there is any point to examining them. The answer is yes, for three reasons. First, much of what is commonly believed about these concepts is mistaken. Second, who ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights. Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the more proficient you will be in your thinking.

第一部分探讨7个重要的概念——个人、理性思维、真理、知识、观点、证据和论点——`每一个都有一章`。这些概念中大部分都很熟悉，以至于你可能倾向于怀疑是否存在研究他们的点。答案是yes，有三个理由。第一，**关于这些概念的很多普遍认知都是错误的**。第二，**曾小心研究它们的人总被回报以新的见解**。第三，**对这些概念理解越透彻，你就越精通你的思维。**
