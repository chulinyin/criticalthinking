> \1. Consider this statement by Greek philosopher Epictetus: “Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things are either what they appear to be; or they neither are nor appear to be; or they are and do not appear to be; or they are not and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man’s task.” Does this reinforce or challenge what you learned in this chapter?Explain.

一、考虑希腊哲学家 Epictetus 这一说法：“`思维有四种外表。事情要么是它们似乎是什么；或者它们既不是也不似乎是；或者它们是且不似乎是；或者它们不是但似乎是。正确地对准所有这些情况是聪明人的任务`。”这是否强化或挑战了你在本章所学到的东西？解释一下。

> \2. Read the following comment by Bernard Goldberg, a journalist and author of Bias: “Here’s one of those dirty little secrets journalists are never supposed to reveal to the regular folks out there in the audience: a reporter can find an expert to say anything the reporter wants—anything! Just keep on calling until one of the experts says what you need him to say and tell him you’ll be right down with a camera crew to interview him. If you find an expert who says, ‘You know, I think that flat tax just might work and here’s why . . .’ you thank him,hang up, and find another expert. It’s how journalists sneak their own personal views into stories in the guise of objective news reporting.”24 What implications does this statement have for the subject of this chapter? Explain your answer.

二、阅读下面拜厄斯新闻记者和作家 Bernard Goldberg 的评论：”这里是新闻记者从来都不应该披露给普通观众的肮脏小秘密中的一条：一个记者可以找到一位专家说任何记者想要的话——任何！只要不停打电话，直到有一位专家说了你想要他说的，并告诉他你将带着电视摄制组采访他。如果你找到一位说‘你知道我认为统一税可能有用，下面是原因......’的专家，你谢谢他，然后挂断电话，找另一位专家。这就是新闻记者如何在客观新闻报道的伪装下偷偷把他们的个人观点放进故事中。“这段话对本章的主题有何启示？解释你的回答。

> \3. In each of the following cases, someone believes he or she knows something. In light of what you learned in this chapter, discuss whether the person really does.

三、在下面每种情况中，一些人相信他/她知道某些东西。根据你在本章所学，讨论那个人是否真的知道。

1. > Ted reads in the morning newspaper that a close friend of his has been arrested and charged with burglarizing a number of stores. Ted is shocked.“It’s impossible. The police have made a mistake,” he tells his mother.“Bob and I have been as close as brothers. I just know he’s not guilty.”

   Ted在晨报中读到他的好朋友被逮捕并被指控盗窃许多商店。Ted 很震惊。“不可能！警察搞错了，”他告诉他妈妈，“Bob 和我曾经亲如兄弟。我知道他没有罪。”

2. > Ralph: Here, Harry, try my antiperspirant. It really stops wetness.
   >
   > Harry: No, thanks. I’m suspicious of antiperspirants. It seems to me that anything designed to block a normal body function may do a lot of harm. I wouldn’t be surprised if it caused cancer.
   >
   > Ralph: Don’t be foolish. I know it doesn’t cause cancer. Products like these are carefully tested before they’re allowed to be sold. If it caused cancer, it would be banned.

   Ralph: 在这里，Harry, 试试我的止汗剂。它真的止湿。

   Harry：不，谢谢。我对止汗剂感到怀疑。在我看来任何旨在阻止正常身体功能的东西都可能造成很多伤害。如果它导致癌症，我也不会感到惊讶。

   Ralph：不要傻了。我知道它不会导致癌症。像这种产品在被允许销售前是会经过仔细测试的。如果它导致癌症，它会被明令禁止。

3. > Jane: I just read there’s some evidence that aspirin can prevent heart attacks.
   >
   > Jenny: That’s a lot of nonsense. I know it can’t. My uncle took lots of aspirin and he died of a heart attack last year.

   Jane：我刚读到，有一些证据表明阿司匹林能够阻止心脏病发作。

   Jenny：那是一派胡言。我知道它不能。我的叔叔吃了很多阿司匹林，然而去年他死于心脏病发作。

> \4. “Man Is Released in Wrong Rape Charges,” “Traditional Idea Debunked,”“Ex-Aide Admits Lying About Lawmakers”—daily newspapers contain numerous stories like these, stories showing how what was “known” a week, a month,or years ago has been found to be false. Find at least three examples of such stories in current or recent newspapers.

四、“男的因为错误的强奸指控被释放”，“传统观念被揭穿”，“前夫助手承认谎报立法者”——日报包含了大量这样的故事，故事展示了在一周、一月或者几年前所知的东西如何被发现是错误的。在目前或者最近的报纸中至少找出三个这类故事的例子。

> \5. “It ain’t what a man doesn’t know that makes him a fool,but what he does know that ain’t so,” wrote Josh Billings, a nineteenth-century American humorist. Recall as many occasions as you can in which your own experience confirmed his observation.

五、"并不是一个人不知道使他变傻，而是他知道的东西"，19世纪的美国幽默作家 Josh Billings 这样写道。回忆尽可能多的场合，你自身的经历证实了他的观察。

> \6. A court case pitting the U.S. government against the American Indian Movement was conducted quietly in South Dakota in late 1982. The government sought to end the Native American group’s twenty-month occupation of public land in the Black Hills National Forest. The group claimed that the area was a holy land to them—their birthplace, the graveyard of their ancestors, and the center of their universe—and therefore should be turned into a permanent, religion-based Native American community. The government maintained that the group had no legal claim to the land. What factors do you think should be considered in a case like this, and what solution would best serve the interests of justice? In answering, be sure to distinguish carefully between what you know and what you assume, guess, or speculate. After answering these questions, check out the most up-to-date version of the story on the Internet. Use the search term “American Indian Movement Black Hills National Forest.”

六、1982年年底，美国政府反对美国印第安人运动的法庭案件在南达科他州安静地进行。政府试图结束印第安人集团对黑山国家森林中公共土地20个月的占领。集团声称该地区是他们的圣地——他们的出生地，他们祖先的墓地，他们世界的中心——因此应该被变为永久的，以宗教为基础的印第安人社区。政府坚称集团没有那块土地的索取权。在这种情况中你认为应该考虑拿些因素，什么解决办法最符合司法利益？在回答中，一定要仔细区分你知道的和你假定、猜测或者推测的。在回答这些问题之后，在网上检验故事的最新版本。使用搜索术语“美国印第安人运动黑山国家森林”。

> \7. In recent years there has been much discussion of the insanity plea as a legal defense. Many believe it should be abolished, but many others regard it as an essential part of any reasonable criminal justice system. What is your position? In answering, be sure to distinguish carefully between what you know and what you assume or guess. If your knowledge is very limited, you might want to do some research.

七、最近几年，已经有许多对于精神失常抗辩作为法律辩护的讨论。许多人认为它应该被废除，但是许多其他人将之视为任何合理的刑事司法系统的重要组成部分。你的立场是什么？在回答中，一定要仔细区分你知道的和你假定或者猜测的。如果你的知识非常有限，你可能想要做一些研究。
