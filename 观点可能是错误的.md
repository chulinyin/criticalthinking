> We might be tempted to conclude that if we are free to have an opinion, it must be correct. That, however, is not the case. Free societies are based on the wise observation that people have an inalienable right to think their own thoughts and make their own choices. But this fact in no way suggests that the thoughts they think and the choices they make will be reasonable. It is a fundamental principle of critical thinking that ideas are seldom of equal quality. Solutions to problems vary from the practical to the impractical, beliefs from the well founded to the ill founded, argu-ments from the logical to the illogical, and opinions from the informed to the uninformed. Critical thinking serves to separate the more worthy from the less worthy and, ultimately, to identify the best.

我们可能会得出结论，如果我们能自由地拥有一个观点，那它一定是正确的。然而，并不是这样的。自由地社会是基于明智的观察，人们拥有不可剥夺的权利来思考他们自己的想法并做出他们自己的选择。但这个事实绝不意味着他们的想法和选择是合理的。想法很少具有同等的质量是理性思维的一个基本原则。问题的解决方法从实际到不切实际，信念从有根据到没有根据，论点从符合逻辑到不合逻辑，观点从有依据到无依据。理性思维有助于从更少的价值中分离出更有价值的东西，并最终确定最好的东西。

> Evidence that opinions can be mistaken is all around us. The weekend drinker often has the opinion that, as long as he doesn’t drink during the week, he is not an alcoholic. The person who continues driving her gas guzzler with the needle on Empty may have the opinion that the problem being signaled can wait for another fifty miles. The student who quits school at age sixteen may have the opinion that an early entry into the job market ultimately improves job security. Yet, however deeply and sincerely such opinions are held, they are most likely wrong.

观点可能是错误的证据一直在我们周围。周末的饮酒者通常认为，只要他不在工作日内喝酒，他就不是一个酒鬼。继续驾驶着指针指向了空的油老虎（耗油量大的车）的人可能认为，正在发信号的问题可以再等上15英里。16岁退学的学生可能认为早点进入就业市场最终可以提高工作安全性。然而，尽管强烈并且真诚地拥有这些观点，它们很可能是错的，

> Research shows that people can be mistaken even when they are making a special effort to judge objectively. Sometimes their errors are caused by considerations so subtle that they are unaware of them. For example, before Taster’s Choice coffee was introduced, it was tested and sampled with three different labels—brown, yellow, and red. People who sampled the brown-labeled coffee reported that it was too strong and kept them awake at night. Those who sampled the yellow-labeled coffee found it weak and watery. Those who sampled the red-labeled coffee judged it to be just the right strength and delicious. All this even though the coffee in each jar was exactly the same. The people had been subconsciously influenced by the color of the label.3

研究表明，即使人们为客观地判断作出特别的努力，他们还是可能犯错。有时他们的错误是由于要考虑的因素太细微了，以致于他们没有意识到。例如，在推出 Taster's Choice 咖啡前，它用三个不同的标签（棕色、黄色和红色）进行测试和抽样。品尝棕色标签咖啡的人报告说它太强了，让他们晚上睡不着。那些品尝黄色标签咖啡的人发现它微弱和太淡。那些品尝红色标签咖啡的人判断它是适合强度并且美味的。所有这一切，即使每杯里的咖啡都是完全一样的。人们受到了标签的颜色的下意识影响。
