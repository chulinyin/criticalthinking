> Writing may be used for either of two broad purposes: to discover ideas or to communicate them. Most of the writing you have done in school is undoubtedly the latter kind. But the former can be very helpful, not only in sorting out ideas you’ve already produced, but also in stimulating the flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.

写作可被用于两个广泛的目的：发现想法，或者为了与想法交流。你在学校中完成的大部分写作无疑是后一种。但是前者可以变得很有用，不仅可用于整理你已经产生的想法，还可用于刺激新想法的流动。由于某种原因，写下一个想法的行为似乎产生了更多的想法。

> Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examining and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don’t worry about organization or correctness. If ideas come slowly, be patient.If they come suddenly, in a rush, don’t try to slow down the process and develop any one of them; simply jot them all down. \(There will be time for elaboration and correction later.\) Direct your mind’s effort, but be sensitive to ideas on the fringe of consciousness. Often they, too, will prove valuable.

每当你为了发现想法写作，专注于你正在调查的问题，并记录你的所有想法、问题和断言。不要担心结构或正确性。如果想法来得缓慢，耐心点。如果它们突然匆忙地来了，不要试图放缓处理和发展它们中的任何之一。简单地把它们都记下来。（之后会有时间去阐述和更正。）指导你的精神的努力，但对意识边缘的想法敏感。通常它们也将证明是很有价值的。

> If you have done your discovery writing well and have thought critically about the ideas you have produced, the task of writing to communicate will be easier and more enjoyable. You will have many more ideas—carefully evaluated ones—to develop and organize.

如果你已经很好地完成了你的发现写作，并理性地思考了你所产生的想法，为了交流而写作的任务将变得更容易、更令人愉快。你将拥有更多的想法——仔细地评估它们——发展并组织。
