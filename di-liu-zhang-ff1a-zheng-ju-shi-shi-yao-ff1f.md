To state an opinion is to tell others what we think about something; to present evidence is to show others that what we think makes sense. Being shown is much more interesting and impressive than being told—we’ve all known this since grade school. Why, then, does so much writing and speaking consist of piling one opinion on another, with little or no evidence offered in support of any of them? As we saw in Chapter 5, one reason is that the human mind is a veritable opinion factory, so most people have an abundance of opinions to share. Another reason is that people tend to remember their opinions and forget the process by which they got them,much as students remember their final grade in a course long after they have forgotten the tests and homework grades that resulted in it.

陈述观点是告诉别人我们对某些事的思考；提出证据是向别人说明我们的思考是有意义的。被说明比被告诉更有趣且更令人印象深刻——我们从小学开始就都知道这个了。那么，为什么这么多的写作和演讲是由一堆观点组成，却很少或者没有提供证据支持其中任何一个观点呢？正如我们在第五章中所看到的，一个原因是人类头脑是一个真正的观点工厂，因此大多数人有很多观点用来分享。另一个原因是，人们倾向于记住他们的观点并忘记的到它们的过程，就像学生只记得他们课程的最终成绩，因为很久以后他们就忘记了那些导致他们最终成绩的考试和作业成绩。

> Another, and in some ways more significant, reason is that sometimes there is little or no evidence to remember—in other words, the opinion is based on nothing substantial. For example, in early 1999 many people held the opinion that William Jefferson Clinton’s lying under oath did not “rise to the level of an impeachable offense.” When asked to explain why they thought that, some people repeated the assertion in identical or similar words: “He shouldn’t be removed from office for what he did” or “It’s between him and Hillary.” Some offered related opinions: “It’s a right-wing conspiracy” or “Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is on a witch-hunt.” Though it is impossible to be certain why they thought as they did, the fact that they expressed the opinion in the very same words incessantly repeated by a half dozen White House advisors and innumerable other Clinton supporters suggests that they simply borrowed the opinion without evaluating it.\*

另外，在某些方面更重要的原因是有时很少或者没有证据可以记——也就是说，观点是基于非真实的。例如，在1999年初，很多人认为克林顿在宣誓下的谎言没有“上升到弹劾的程度。”当被要求解释他们为什么那样认为时，一些人用相同或相似的话重述这一主张：“他不应该为他所做的事情被罢免”或者“这是他和希拉里间的事。”一些人提出了相关的观点：”这是右翼的阴谋“或者”独立检察官 Kenneth Starr 是在进行政治迫害。“虽然不可能确定他们为什么这样认为，但事实是他们表达观点的话和不断由半打白宫顾问以及很多其他克林顿支持者重复的话一样，这表明他们只是在借用观点而没有评估它。

> We can all identify with those people. More often than most of us would care to admit, when called on to support our opinions, we manage to produce only the flimsiest of evidence. We may soothe ourselves with the notion that a thick folder of evidence lies misfiled in our minds, but the very real possibility remains that flimsy evidence was all we ever had. Critical thinkers are tempted to commit the same self-deception that plagues others, but they have learned the value of resisting that temptation. More important, they have developed the habit of checking the quality and quantity of the evidence before forming an opinion. Also, they review their evidence before expressing an opinion. The extra time this takes is more than compensated for by the confidence that comes from knowing what they are talking about.

我们都可以认同这些人。我们大多数人常常承认，当被要求支持我们的观点时，我们设法只产生最脆弱的证据。我们可以安慰自己说一个厚厚文件夹的证据错误归档在我们的脑中，但是真正的可能性仍然是我们曾经有过的证据都是脆弱的。理性思考者也想提出纠缠着他人的自我欺骗，但是他们已经学到了抵抗那种诱惑的价值。更重要的是，他们已经养成了在形成一个观点以前查明证据的质量和数量的习惯。此外，他们还在表达一个观点以前审查他们的证据。这样花费的额外时间是来自于他们知道自己在说什么的信心，而不是补偿。
