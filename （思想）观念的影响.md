When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably.7 In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term sequitur, Latin for “it follows.” \(The converse is non sequitur, “it does not follow.”\)8

当一个观念被表达，逻辑上、不可避免地，密切相关的观念被同时传达。在逻辑上，这种亲属关系通过术语“推论”，拉丁文“它跟随”表达。（相反是没有推论，“它不跟随”）

Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express to young children as a way of encouraging them: “If  you believe in yourself, you can succeed at anything.” From this it follows that nothing else but belief—neither talent nor hard  work—is necessary for success. The reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably linked.\*

例如，考虑许多老师和家长对幼儿表示鼓励的观念：“如果你相信你自己，你可以在任何事上成功。”由此可以得出，只有信念——既不是天赋也不是努力工作——是成功必须的。这两个观念是等价的，因为它们的意义是密不可分的。

In addition to conveying ideas closely linked to it in meaning, an idea can imply other ideas. For example, the idea that there is  no real difference between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by common moral standards. Samuel  Johnson had this implication in mind when he said: “But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and  vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.”

除了传达意义密切相关的观念，一个观念也可以暗示其他观念。例如，善与恶没有真正区别的观念，意味着人们不应该受到共同的道德标准的束缚。Samuel Johnson 在心里有这种暗示，当他说：“但是如果他真的认为善恶没有区别，为什么，先生，当他离开我们的家，让我们数我们的勺子？”

If we were fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implications of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the  sound ones from the unsound,  the wise from foolish, and the helpful from the harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. In  many cases, we take ideas at face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meanings and  implications. In the course of time, our actions are shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not.

如果我们充分意识到我们所遇到的观念的密切相关的意义和暗示，我们可以轻易地区分合理的和不合理的， 聪明的和愚蠢的，有益的 和有害的。但是我们很少充分意识到。在很多情况下，我们接受了观念的表面价值，并且拥抱它们，很少或者根本没有想到他们相关的意义和暗示。随着时间的推移，我们的行为是由那些意义和暗示塑造的，无论我们是否有意识到它们。

To appreciate the influence of ideas in people’s lives, consider the series of events set in motion by an idea that was popular in  psychology more than a century ago and whose influence continues to this day—the idea that “intelligence is genetically  determined and cannot be increased.”

要理解观念在人们生活中的影响，考虑一个在一个多世纪前，在心理学中流行并且其影响持续到今天的观念—— “智商是遗传决定的，不能被提高。” 所触发的一系列事件。

* That idea led researchers to devise tests that measure intelligence. The most famous \(badly flawed\) test determined that the  average mental age of white American adults was 13 and that, among immigrants, the average Russian’s mental age was  11.34; the average Italian’s, 11.01; the average Pole’s, 10.74; and the average mental age of “Negroes,” 10.41.

  这个观念导致研究人员设计出了测量智商的测试。最著名的（严重缺陷）测试确定，美国成年白人的平均心理年龄是13岁，在移民中，俄罗斯的平均心理年龄是11.34岁，意大利的是11.01岁；极点的平均是10.74岁。黑人的平均心理年龄是10.41岁。

* Educators read the text results and thought, “Attempts to raise students’ intelligence are pointless,” so they replaced academic  curricula with vocational curricula and embraced a methodology that taught students facts but not the process of judgment.

  教育家们读了研究结果并认为，“试图提高学生们的智商是无意义的，”所以他们用职业课程取代学术课程，并采用一种教学生们事实而不是判断过程的方法。


\*The statement “Belief in oneself is an important element in success” is very different because it specifies that belief is not the only element in success.

“相信自己是成功的一个重要因素”的说法是非常不同的，因为它指出信念不是成功的唯一因素。



* Legislators read the test results and decided “We’ve got to do something to keep intellectually inferior people from entering the country,” so they revised immigration laws to discriminate against southern and central Europeans.




* Eugenicists, who had long been concerned about the welfare of the human species, saw the tests as a grave warning. They  thought, “If intelligence cannot be increased, we must find ways of encouraging reproduction among people of higher  intelligence and discouraging it among those of lower intelligence.”




* The eugenicists’ concern inspired a variety of actions. Margaret Sanger’s Planned Parenthood urged the lower classes to  practice contraception. Others succeeded in legalizing promoted forced sterilization, notably in Virginia. The U.S. Supreme  Court upheld the Virginia law with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. declaring, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”9  Over the next five decades 7,500 women, including “unwed mothers, prostitutes, petty criminals and children with disciplinary  problems” were sterilized.10 In addition, by 1950 over 150,000 supposedly “defective” children, many relatively normal, were  held against their will in institutions. They “endured isolation, overcrowding, forced labor, and physical abuse including  lobotomy, electroshock, and surgical sterilization.”11




* Meanwhile, business leaders read the test results and decided, “We need policies to ensure that workers leave their minds at  the factory gate and perform their assigned tasks mindlessly.” So they enacted those policies. Decades later, when Edwards   Deming proposed his “quality control” ideas for involving workers in decision making, business leaders remembered those test  results and ignored Deming’s advice. \(In contrast, the Japanese welcomed Deming’s ideas; as a result, several of their  industries surged ahead of their American competition.\) 




These are the most obvious effects of hereditarianism but they are certainly not the only ones. Others include discrimination  against racial and ethnic minorities and the often-paternalistic policies of government offered in response. \(Some historians  also link hereditarianism to the genocide that occurred in Nazi Germany.\)



The innumerable ideas you have encountered will affect your beliefs and behavior in similar ways––sometimes slightly, at other  times profoundly. And this can happen even if you have not consciously embraced the ideas.
