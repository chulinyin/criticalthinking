When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably.7 In logic, this kinship is expressed by the term sequitur, Latin for “it follows.” \(The converse is non sequitur, “it does not follow.”\)8

当一个观念被表达，逻辑上、不可避免地，密切相关的观念被同时传达。在逻辑上，这种亲属关系通过术语“推论”，拉丁文“它跟随”表达。（相反是没有推论，“它不跟随”）

Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express to young children as a way of encouraging them: “If  you believe in yourself, you can succeed at anything.” From this it follows that nothing else but belief—neither talent nor hard  work—is necessary for success. The reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably linked.\*



In addition to conveying ideas closely linked to it in meaning, an idea can imply other ideas. For example, the idea that there is  no real difference between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by common moral standards. Samuel  Johnson had this implication in mind when he said: “But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and  vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.”



If we were fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implications of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the  sound ones from the unsound, the wise from the foolish, and the helpful from the harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. In  many cases, we take ideas at face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meanings and  implications. In the course of time, our actions are shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not.



To appreciate the influence of ideas in people’s lives, consider the series of events set in motion by an idea that was popular in  psychology more than a century ago and whose influence continues to this day—the idea that “intelligence is genetically  determined and cannot be increased.”



That idea led researchers to devise tests that measure intelligence. The most famous \(badly flawed\) test determined that the  average mental age of white American adults was 13 and that, among immigrants, the average Russian’s mental age was  11.34; the average Italian’s, 11.01; the average Pole’s, 10.74; and the average mental age of “Negroes,” 10.41.



Educators read the text results and thought, “Attempts to raise students’ intelligence are pointless,” so they replaced academic  curricula with vocational curricula and embraced a methodology that taught students facts but not the process of judgment.



\*The statement “Belief in oneself is an important element in success” is very different because it specifies that belief is not the only element in success.
